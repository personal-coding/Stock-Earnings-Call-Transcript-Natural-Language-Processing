Mary N. Dillon - Chief Executive Officer & Director
Thanks, Laurel, good afternoon and we have a lot to share with everyone today. Our fourth quarter results capped an exceptional year. We made significant progress against our strategic imperatives, while achieving outstanding sales and earnings growth. We continue to benefit from the powerful combination of strong demand in the beauty category and Ulta Beauty's highly differentiated products and service offering. This unique positioning is driving business results that transcend prevailing trends across the retail landscape.
To review the fourth quarter highlights, we grew the top line 21.1% and delivered 12.5% comps on top of 11.1% comps in the fourth quarter of 2014, which was our toughest comp of the year. Comp sales were driven primarily by traffic, yet ticket increased nicely as well. The fourth quarter delivered the best two-year comp since 2011 with a 23.6% two-year stack. Product newness, our loyalty program, great in-store execution, and investments in marketing and store payroll hours are fueling this industry leading growth across both retail and online, with the fastest category growth in cosmetics on both mass and prestige sides of the portfolio.
E-commerce top line growth and profitability were better than plan, driven by improved fulfillment capabilities and execution during the holiday season. And our salon business maintained its solid top line performance.
For the full year of 2015, we achieved 11.8% comp, our best annual comp since 2010, with double-digit comps in each of the three businesses: stores, salon, and e-commerce. Sales strength was driven primarily by traffic each quarter during the year, and the full year comp was comprised of a very healthy mix of 70% transaction growth and 30% ticket growth.
Before updating you on the drivers of our fourth quarter results, I'd like to take a few of the teams' accomplishments throughout fiscal 2015. We drove top line growth of 21.1% and earnings increased 25.2%, well above our expectations at the beginning of the year, reflecting robust market share gains and strong execution. We brought significant newness and exclusivity to the merchandise assortment, and added 26 significant new brands during the year, demonstrating increased traction with our brand partners.
We accelerated growth in our ULTAmate Rewards loyalty program membership, adding 3.2 million members to reach a total of 18.2 million active members by year-end. We meaningfully increased brand awareness through our investments in television, radio, digital advertising and PR. We achieved strong and increased guest satisfaction scores as measured by NPS.
We improved our supply chain operations in a few ways. We invested in better processes and inventory to increase in-stock levels. We drove efficiencies in our e-commerce fulfillment performance, and smoothly launched the Greenwood distribution center. We also delivered against complex IT goals with the implementation of a host of new tools across the enterprise: our new warehouse management system, our new merchandise forecasting and replenishment system, and a new product information tool, among others.
So, for the past several quarters, we've been describing to the investment community our progress against our six go-to-market strategic imperatives. But we rarely discussed externally our foundational seventh strategic imperative, which is talent that drives a winning culture: guest-centric, value-based, high performance.
I believe that the results we've just reported are the reflection of our traffic category, down (05:22) strategies, great execution and also the progress we've made in building our company's culture. I'm still proud to see proof that our commitment to putting the guest and the associate at the center of our mindset is truly delivering marketplace results. We're respecting the opinions of those who matter the most: the guests, who give us her hard earned money; and the associates who really knows best how to optimize the guest experience and our operations.
We're also reading through the lenses of functional expertise, enterprise-wide thinking, and collaboration, which is required more than ever in this fast-chasing world of guest expectations. We now have evidenced that these efforts are having an impact, not just in business results, but also in our culture. In fact, we saw significant year-over-year increases in the level of engagement of our associates as measured by a third-party through our annual culture survey. We are gratified to achieve global top-quartile employee engagement scores among best-in-class companies. Highly engaged employees are tightly correlated with high performing companies.
So now, let's turn back to our fourth quarter results. In an effort to allow more time for Q&A, instead of going through each of our strategic imperatives, I'll call out some of the highlights driving our performance. Our loyalty program is truly one of our most valuable assets. Asset membership grew 23%, showing continued acceleration. The growth in our loyalty program has been driven by two major things. The successful evolution of our marketing strategies to include awareness driving tactics like television, radio and digital, is driving brand awareness and new guests to our stores.
In addition, our store associates have done a terrific job of making new guests aware of the ULTAmate Rewards program and then converting them in. At the beginning of 2015, active member year-over-year growth was a bit less than 17%, and that growth rate increased each month throughout the year. We're seeing excellent trends in retention rates, sales per member, frequency of purchase and average ticket.
Reactivation of loyalty members, who hadn't shopped in the past 12 months, remains robust as well, another indicator of the benefits of the changes in our marketing model. As we discussed at our Analyst Day in 2014, we're conducting ongoing marketing mix analyses using a customized modeling tool that correlates sales results to in-market actions at the store and category level. This work clearly demonstrates that we've successfully and profitably delivered on the promise of getting to a healthier mix of marketing strategies and tactics.
We're dedicating more resources to personalize offers through a loyalty program and newer tactics, including television, radio, expanded digital and PR. These marketing campaigns are designed to position Ulta Beauty in a meaningful and differentiated way with every piece of communication reinforcing our brand personality and elevating our beauty authority. This reallocation of resources increases the impact of marketing and we believe it's one of the several factors fueling the strength in our comp sales.
While we're reducing our spend on less productive tactics, to be clear, we will always make sure that our guests see Ulta Beauty as providing a great value in periodic promotions, loyalty offers, newness and great experiences in-store and online are all part of that value equation. These changes for our marketing strategy are also driving meaningful improvements in our brand awareness.
Our latest survey showed that aided awareness rose to 84% versus 77% a year ago, and unaided brand awareness improved to 39% from 36%. We believe this increase in awareness was driven in part by our national advertising campaign. Stronger awareness of Ulta Beauty is helping us to acquire new guests and reactivating guests who hadn't shopped recently.
Now, in terms of merchandising, we continue to gain share in all categories with particular strength in mass and prestige cosmetics. Urban Decay, It Cosmetics, Nyx, Redken, Too Faced, Tarte, Clinique, LancÃ´me, Benefit and the Ulta Beauty Collection were among the best performing brands for the quarter. We launched several new brands in our skincare area, including Julep and First Aid Beauty.
The pipeline of new brands for 2016 includes exclusive brands like Jessica Alba's Honest Beauty, and Fiona Stiles Cosmetics, as well as the introduction of Buxom color cosmetics and the expansion of Clarins skincare and cosmetics. We continue to focus on products that are only available at Ulta Beauty with the addition of many exclusive products within existing brands, including a new line of color cosmetics from Tarte called Double Duty Beauty.
We're very excited to work with our brand partners to accelerate the rollout of Clinique, LancÃ´me, and Benefit boutiques in hundreds of stores this year that will make us even more of a beauty destination. Our brand partners are finding increasing value in working with our CRM platform. The number of brands participating in targeted CRM campaigns rose meaningfully last year. We partner with them to increase the number of targeted e-mail and direct mail campaigns, and to develop exclusive offers for platinum members.
All of these efforts drove incremental sales and margin dollars. Our brand partners also love working with our data analytics team to drive trial of various products and categories. We continue to put product samples in the hands of our guests in several smart ways. It would triple the number of samples obtained from our brand partners during 2015.
We're executing our sampling programs through online beauty bags and targeted samples to surprise and delight our guests at point-of-sale and store. We also have sample box programs in fragrance, professional hair care, prestige skincare, and mass haircare that have proven to be extremely popular. And we doubled our sales of these multi-brand sample boxes during 2015. For example, our sample box called Secrets to Gorgeous Skin offered during a recent Skin Event was a big hit. And we plan to offer many more of these sample boxes in 2016.
Turning to services, the salon business comped 9.2% with continued strength in cut and color. Blowouts, hair treatments and makeup services were the highest growth categories. We're delivering trend-right training to our salon professionals and continue to integrate hair and makeup in our offerings. Our hand-picked Artistic Team work to develop haircuts, color and finishing techniques that are reflective of the season, then creates and delivers high-impact training programs for all the salon teams in our stores.
The trends curated by our team translate hair and makeup looks straight from the runway in partnership with our brand. We've recently launched spring and summer trends including nine different hair and makeup looks, such as Festival Style Hair, and pearlescent glow makeup. The Benefit Brow Bar continued its excellent performance with double-digit comp sales and a continued expansion of brow services now in 712 stores.
To report on store growth, we opened 14 stores in the fourth quarter to complete our 2015 program of 100 net new stores, ending with 874 stores. New store productivity continues to be very strong, reflecting our growing brand awareness, dedicated resources to grand opening activities, ongoing improvements to our portfolio of brands, and high quality real estate. We are increasingly a tenant of choice as landlords appreciate our growth profile, our ability to drive traffic to shopping centers, and willingness of other retailers to follow in our footsteps to participate in the healthy traffic we draw.
Landlords also appreciate the quality of our store design and the way our differentiated offering enhances the mix of retailers in their shopping centers. We also continue to enhance the store portfolio through improvements to our new store format, as well as investments to elevate existing stores. For the 2016 class of stores, we'll be implementing a series of enhancements to our store format that elevates both mass and prestige categories, give us the flexibility to respond to our growing access to brands, improve the signage and presentation of our Ulta Beauty Collection, and upgrade fixtures in key categories such as fragrance.
New stores will also put the excitement of our services offering more on the forefront, by placing the Benefit Brow Bar front and center. We'll also fully remodel about a dozen stores this year and touch 100 stores in the fleet with prestige boutiques and remodeled fixtures in key categories.
So I'll take you on our e-commerce business. Topline growth of 44.2% contributed 210 basis points to our total company comp. Significant improvements in fulfillment speed and customer satisfaction during holiday resulted in stronger than expected sales and much better profitability compared to year ago. We added Clinique to the ULTA.com assortment during the fourth quarter, so at this point e-commerce is virtually at parity with brick-and-mortar in terms of our breadth of assortment. We continue to launch some new brands online to test before rolling out to the stores, and offer some brands online only such as an expanded assortment of men's products.
Moving on to supply chain. We are clearly seeing the benefit of cross-functional collaboration and joint planning among our supply chain, e-commerce, and IT teams as well as store operations. Our focus on continuous improvement in simplifying processes led to efficiencies across our network of four distribution centers. During holiday, we achieved record network e-commerce throughput of 55,000 orders in one day, almost double our maximum volume last year.
Shipping lead times improved dramatically with a percentage of order shipped in three days or less at 92% versus just 14% last year, significantly increasing guest satisfaction. In stock levels improved despite achieving sales well over our holiday sales forecast. The Greenwood DC successfully ramped up to serve 125 stores through the holiday season and delivered 25,000 orders per day during peak holiday.
We remain very pleased with how the new DC is performing. We continue to ramp and serve another 100 plus stores in Greenwood by the end of this year. The new Dallas DC is on track to open this summer and we continue to rollout new systems like Swift (16:32), our merchandise forecasting replenishment tool, and we're also investing in space and assortment planning tools this year.
Now, let me turn over to Scott to discuss the key drivers of our fourth quarter financial performance and our outlook for the first quarter and full-year of 2016.
Scott M. Settersten - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer and Assistant Secretary
Thanks, Mary. Good afternoon, everyone. I'll start with the income statement. Topline growth was driven by a 12.5% comp and a very strong new store productivity. The marketing mix analysis that Mary mentioned, show that we were able to achieve this comp through a healthier mix of business drivers including new brand launches and new products, more effective marketing, including TV, radio and digital, more efficient in-store labor and continued benefits from new store maturation. Increased sales of gift cards helped drive topline strength post-holiday.
During the fourth quarter, our comp continued to be a bit more weighted to transaction growth, with traffic about 70% of the comps and average ticket representing about 30%. For retail-only the 10.4% comp was composed of about 75% transaction growth and 25% ticket growth. Units per transaction were flat, but average basket rose 3% to just over $43. E-commerce growth was driven roughly 75% by traffic and 25% by ticket.
Now, let's talk about the key drivers of the 120 basis points of gross profit improvement, which was quite a bit better than our initial plan. The increase was partly driven by higher merchandise margins due to mix as we delivered strong sales in many of our better margin categories and brands, including the Ulta Beauty Collection. We also successfully continued our shift away from broad coupons and discounts and towards more targeted and relevant offers to our guests, supported by our loyalty program and CRM.
In fact, we completely eliminated one of our usual discount offers at the end of the quarter, which helped our margin rate. We leveraged store rent and occupancy expenses modestly on a double-digit comp. And while our supply chain investments were still a drag on margins, they were less so than in the third quarter, when we first opened the Greenwood, Indiana DC.
E-commerce fulfillment costs were also much more favorable this year. You probably recall that during the holiday season of 2014, we were challenged with fulfilling orders during the spike in demand between Black Friday and Cyber Monday, and the higher than expected e-commerce fulfillment costs for holiday 2014 weighed on gross profit a year ago, creating an easier margin comparison in the fourth quarter.
The team did a much better job getting orders to customers in a timely fashion during the 2015 holiday season. In addition to the successful launch of the Greenwood DC, which provided additional capacity, we also increased the efficiency of our other distribution centers with process improvements throughout the year.
The e-commerce marketing team did a nice job smoothing out consumer demand during the holiday season with promotional events planned before and after the Black Friday period, culminating in a much improved guest experience and significant profit improvement. The product mix for e-commerce continues to help as well, as we ramp up sales of high margin hair care products which were added to the site last February.
Moving on to SG&A expense. Deleverage of 100 basis points was driven primarily by planned investments and marketing and store payroll hours to support holiday season sales. While marketing expense was flat for the year, it was back half-weighted with the introduction of new vehicles to drive brand awareness, including the national TV and radio campaigns. We also invested in store labor hours and training to improve the guest experience, especially during the key selling weeks during the holiday. Corporate overhead also deleveraged slightly due to higher incentive compensation in concert with our better than expected earnings performance.
In terms of the balance sheet, inventories were up 16.1% on a per store basis, driven by investments in inventory to keep up with much better than expected topline growth, several new brand additions, and the continued expansion of Clinique and LancÃ´me boutiques.
The team did a great job selling through holiday inventory and making sure we start the new year with very clean inventory across all categories. While we generally strive to keep inventory per door growth in line with comp growth, we had compelling business reasons to modestly exceed that benchmark, and are very happy with the quality of our inventory, and the resulting sales growth. With the large number of prestige brand boutiques and new brands being added in 2016, we expect inventory per door growth to remain somewhat elevated for the rest of the year, although at a slightly lower level than Q4.
Capital expenditures were $67 million for the quarter driven by 14 new store openings, investments in systems, store fixtures and supply chain. CapEx for the full-year was $299 million. We ended the year with $476 million of cash and short-term investments. The company repurchased approximately 262,000 shares at a cost of $46 million during the fourth quarter under our 10b5-1 plan. For the full-year, we've repurchased just over 1 million shares for $167 million. This reduction in our shares outstanding delivered about $0.03 of earnings per share growth for fiscal 2015.
Today, we announced our 2016 guidance. In light of our accelerated share repurchase plan and continued momentum in our comparable sales growth, our anticipated earnings per share growth rate is higher than what we expected when we discussed our five-year plan back in the fall of 2014. We plan to add 100 net new stores with all stores in the program in our traditional prototypical store size. We expect to open 11 stores in Q1, 21 stores in Q2, 44 stores in Q3, and 24 stores in Q4. We plan to complete 12 major store remodels and two relocations. We expect to grow e-commerce above 40%.
Total company comps are expected to be in the 8% to 10% range. We anticipate earnings per share growth of approximately 18% to 20%. Operating margins are expected to be flattish, similar to what we achieved in 2015. Gross profit margin will be pressured by our new Dallas DC coming online this summer, continued investments in core merchandising systems, and depreciation and write-offs related to our accelerate boutique rollout and store refresh program.
CapEx has been planned higher than our previous view, which was in the $300 million range. We now anticipate CapEx of about $390 million. This includes slightly higher CapEx per new store with the latest enhancements that Mary mentioned as well as a significant step up in boutiques in our new store program.
We have also added about $80 million to the capital plan to refresh hundreds of our existing stores, which will include a major expansion of Clinique, LancÃ´me and Benefit boutiques, as well as a significant presentation upgrade for fragrance and the Ulta Beauty Collection. We believe these prestige boutiques drive increased productivity in our stores and improve our positioning as a beauty destination. We are delighted that our brand partners want to grow even faster with us.
In terms of share buybacks, our Board of Directors has authorized a new share repurchase program for $425 million, which replaces the previous program. As you saw in the press release, we announced an ASR for $200 million and expect to continue our open market repurchases, similar to what we did in 2015.
Turning now to guidance for the first quarter. We anticipate sales to be in the range of $1.016 billion to $1.033 billion compared to $868 million last year. We expect comparable sales to increase in the range of 9% to 11% versus 11.4% last year. Online sales growth is expected to be in the 40% range. Pre-opening expense for the quarter is expected to be about $2.5 million, earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $1.25 to $1.30 versus $1.04 for Q1 of last year. We anticipate a tax rate of 37.8% and fully diluted share count of approximately 64 million.
I'll now turn the call over to our conference call host for the Q&A session. Operator?

Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of David Schick with Stifel. Please state your question.
David Schick - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
Hi. It's David Schick and thanks for taking my question. Congratulations on the quarter. Just a quick question or a basic question on salon, and then a quick question on gross margin. On salon, you're lapping those incremental salon booking capabilities already, and then â but the business is continuing to grow quite nicely. Can you talk about how you're able to grow that rapidly despite that lap? And then, separately, any color on how much private label is benefiting gross margin, would be helpful. Thank you.
Mary N. Dillon - Chief Executive Officer & Director
Sure. I'll start on the salon question, Dave, thank you. The salon business right now is â we're pleased with the growth. It's interesting only â it's really under 7% of our loyalty members are currently using the salon services. So, there is no reason for us to think that we can't just continue to grow that nicely by getting â driving more awareness of salon and more trial.
So the online booking tool is certainly one step in that direction, which is great. But we anticipate that as we think about how we can continue to drive awareness and trial and rebooking in our salons, that we'll be able to continue to grow that for years to come. As I mentioned in the script, we've got plenty of excellent offerings for our guests whether it's new trends right off the runway on cut and color, even things that people can try just for the first time like a blowout or a make-up service. So there's plenty of growth that we believe we can drive ahead there. In terms of the private label margins...
Scott M. Settersten - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer and Assistant Secretary
Yeah. Let me jump in there, Dave.
Mary N. Dillon - Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yes. Go ahead.
Scott M. Settersten - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer and Assistant Secretary
So we don't breakout specific categories or rate contributions by line, but obviously private label is a very high margin category for us. It's something that's key to the mix overall for Ulta and something that we use, right? We use â strategically to help drive the business overall both on the top and bottom lines.
David Schick - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
Thank you.

Our next question comes from Kelly Halsor with Buckingham Research. Please state your question.
Kelly L. Halsor - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.
Hi, guys. Congrats on a great quarter. Thanks for taking my questions. I guess given the momentum that you are seeing in the business here, how do we â how should we think about some of the metrics that are implied in your longer-term targets? Is this â given the potential, given the strength of the categories across the board, any thoughts on the potential upside to margins, et cetera from here? Thanks.
Mary N. Dillon - Chief Executive Officer & Director
Thank you, Kelly. Yeah. First of all, we're thrilled with the results and the momentum in the business today for sure and excited about that as we move forward. I would say this, we're very confident and we remain confident in the mid-teen operating margin target that we put out for our long-term guidance. And that's going to be a combination of growing topline, driving efficiencies, also investing for the long-term health of the business.
Having said that, there is also plenty of questions ahead as it relates to guest expectations in a changing retail environment. So we want to retain some flexibility to continue to think about innovation in that area. So we'll continually be refreshing our five-year view. At this point, we don't have any reason to think we'll change our five-year financial guidance though.
Kelly L. Halsor - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.
Okay, great. Thanks. And just if I could squeeze in one more here. Could you just give any color...
Mary N. Dillon - Chief Executive Officer & Director
Nice job, Kelly, squeezing in a second question.
Kelly L. Halsor - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.
It'll be quick. Just in terms of the categories, I mean was the growth still largely driven by the strength of cosmetics? Are we seeing any strength in the categories...
Mary N. Dillon - Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yeah, let me turn this one to Dave.
David C. Kimbell - Chief Merchandising and Marketing Officer
Yeah. Kelly, Mary mentioned in the script that cosmetics has certainly been very strong for us both in the prestige and the mass side, but we're really excited that we're seeing growth across really the whole store. The thing that makes us different is the unique combination of assortment, All Things Beauty, All in One Place, and we're seeing growth in hair for sure, it's a huge foundational element for us. So all aspects of hair, fragrance, skincare, accessories, so we're getting growth in all categories, but it is being led by cosmetics.
Kelly L. Halsor - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.
Okay, great. Thanks, guys.

Our next question comes from Omar Saad with Evercore ISI. Please state your question.
Omar Saad - Evercore ISI
Thanks for talking my question. Great quarter, great holiday quarter. I was really intrigued by the 10% to 12% comp guidance for 2016. I can't remember you guys giving comp guidance so high. And I'd love to hear maybe what are some of the factors that give you confidence this early in the year, and obviously the current trends are very strong but what's causing kind of the sea change in your confidence to be able to deliver that level of comp, especially in a retail environment where there is so little traffic out there? Is it the loyalty? Is it the new marketing campaigns? Is it something you're seeing in the store aging, the way older and new stores are behaving? I would love any more details there. Thanks
Mary N. Dillon - Chief Executive Officer & Director
Well, Omar, first I'll say you're on the right track and that it's a lot of things. But let me tell you this, we're very excited about our comps, but we guided 8% to 10% for the year, just to be clear, okay? So that's what we just communicated. But stepping back â we're pleased with that, I would say that, as we're coming into this year, I guess, what I would say is that, at the highest level, this is a business model that's working and we're executing it really well.
And so we feel confident about the momentum and that continuing. It's a combination of a lot of factors coming together. So if you'll indulge me, let me just spend a minute on this, which is, first of all, it's great that we're in a great category that is a growing category, right? And so that's important to start with. And there is expandable consumption of beauty products. So these are everyday use, sometimes multiple times a day driven by innovation, there's plenty of innovation. So we're in a growing business, we at Ulta Beauty have a really, I think, very clear bead on who our target guest is and how to position ourselves against this guest. So this beauty enthusiast is a large and growing segment.
Dave just mentioned it, we are positioned as All Things Beauty, All in One Place, which is differentiated and relevant to that segment. We have exceptional brand partnerships, so it's about knowing who we're trying to target, but also offering her what she wants, so exciting products, new and exclusive. Really working with our brand partners to continue to have the great assortment of cross-category price point services, I'd also add that smarter use of demand creation tools. So our loyalty program is really the heart, I talked about that. We've got long-term awareness in equity building tools moving in the right direction, the role of e-com and digital improved especially on the guest service side of that as well. So the demand creation tools are working well. And then I'd say just exceptional collaboration in our â with our teams and executing against complex things.
So it's about making sure that the in-store experience is exceptional and that takes a lot, whether it's payroll hours or investing it in stock; the distribution side of it, the focus that our Greenwood Distribution Center, the IT systems to support it. And real estate is a core competency for us and we're quite good at selecting store locations, building them out, remodeling, and store productivity is even stronger than we expected it to be. So I would say that truly is a notion of kind of a great market opportunity coming together and being executed well.
And last thing I'd say is that we also are less subject to some other factors that some of the retailers are, so whether it weather, maybe weak mall traffic, or fashion hits or misses, a few other things, we're less subject to that. So you pull that together it helps. I feel very confident that we can transcend what seems to be overall retail trend and deliver the kind of comps that we just guided with you.
Omar Saad - Evercore ISI
Thanks for the color, Mary.

Our next question comes from Steph Wissink with Piper Jaffray. Please state your question.
Stephanie Schiller Wissink - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)
Good afternoon, everyone. I'll add our congratulations as well. Mary just an observation, it seems like you've moved from a position of you desiring bigger and better brands to bigger and better brands desiring you. So I'm wondering if you can talk a little bit about the 26 brands you added in 2015. How important were those to the comp? And also what are the plans for 2016 in terms of new brand additions? I think you mentioned several hundred boutiques, (35:36) if you could give us a little more color on the specific number? And then on any investments you're making in merchandising? Thank you.
Mary N. Dillon - Chief Executive Officer & Director
Steph, thank you for the question. And I'd like to turn it over to Dave, because he and his team are really the experts at all of these things. Go ahead, Dave.
David C. Kimbell - Chief Merchandising and Marketing Officer
Yeah. That's great. First, I'll start with new brands. That has been something that we have been focused on for a long time. We've added well over 100 new brands over the last five years. And as you said, and as Mary mentioned, we have 26 new brands in 2015 alone and that included brands, we brought Dior in late in the year, Skyn Iceland, Soap & Glory, First Aid Beauty, Revolution Makeup (sic) [Makeup Revolution] (36:15), Pacifica, Tony Moly, several others that were key across all categories and all different mass and prestige and hair. And so we brought growth. And we're really excited to be continuing to partner with our brands to leverage growth. And we feel like we've got a great relationship that has been in â that has been building and strengthening for many years and we're excited about our ability to do that.
We've got â Mary mentioned a couple, but as we look forward into 2016, we're as excited for the upcoming years as we were in our results in 2015. We've got some great brands already that have already come out in the spring trend magazine that you may have seen that came out. We featured over 2,000 new items across new brands and existing brands, just in that magazine alone.
Some key new brands that we're offering Honest Beauty, just launched, Mary mentioned that, Jessica Alba's brand that is exclusive with us; Fiona Stiles also exclusive with us. Fiona is a well-known makeup artist and we're proud to be working with her. Our existing brands continue to bring newness and excitement to us. Mary mentioned, Tarte with their Double Duty Beauty and we're finding growth across all of our key brands both big and small, continuing to expand and rollout brands like that we launched last year BECCA, Clarins, Clinique and LancÃ´me, which I'll touch on in just a second.
And then all of our big brands â our big partners across every part of our store are great partners in finding new ways to grow and we're excited to be working with them on brands like a Bare and Too Faced and Philosophy and Urban Decay and Benefit and Chi and Redken and Matrix, the list goes on, Nioxin and L'OrÃ©al. So we're excited to be working on with our brand partners and we think we've got a rich pipeline to come.
On boutiques specifically, we did mention that we're continuing to expand. I'd say boutiques are an important part of our growth plan, should be evident by this, they're not the only part of our growth plan, we're â but we're really excited to be continuing to work. We have four main boutique brands, Bare has been our largest boutique brands and they are essentially in every store. We're continuing to rollout Benefit. We have â they were in roughly 700 stores at the end of last year. And then, over the last several years we've been partnering and expanding our relationship with Clinique and LancÃ´me; each of them ended up with roughly 200 stores at the end of the year.
In total, across the ones that we're continuing to expand into existing doors and new doors, Benefit Clinique and LancÃ´me; we'll be adding over 500 boutiques across those three brands in 2016. So we're excited about all the brand innovation and brand expansion that will be coming this year.

Our next question comes from Adrienne Yih with Wolfe Research. Please state your question.
Adrienne Yih-Tennant - Wolfe Research LLC
Good afternoon and let me add my congratulations. I was wondering if you can talk about the penetration in 2015 of the e-com business and your private label, and then your exclusives. It seems like there's a lot of growth opportunity in those three areas. So if you could give us a little more color on that that will be great. Thanks.
David C. Kimbell - Chief Merchandising and Marketing Officer
Yeah. Private label in total; when we look at total private label we include our Ulta Beauty Collection and then some exclusive co-brands like our IT Brushes With ULTA (sic) [IT Brushes For ULTA] (40:16) and those represent approximately 6% of our sales in 2015. Our e-commerce penetration ended about 6% as well for 2015. So those are â and they both have been growing. We're continuing to expand. As the rest of our business grows on a penetration basis there, we're seeing incremental growth in each of those areas as well. And was there a third? Sorry [ph] just repeat. (40:49)
Adrienne Yih-Tennant - Wolfe Research LLC
The exclusives.
David C. Kimbell - Chief Merchandising and Marketing Officer
Exclusives. Well, so I rolled in some exclusively like co-branded like our It Cosmetics. We look at a lot of exclusivity and we don't really have a number that we look at with that, but within nearly every brand and certainly every major brand that we have, we have exclusive products or lines, Tarte Double Duty Beauty is one example that I've already talked about and we have quite a few of those throughout the entire store.

Our next question comes from Simeon Siegel with Nomura Securities. Please state your question.
Simeon A. Siegel - Nomura Securities International, Inc.
Thanks. Hey, guys. Congrats on a really strong finish to the year. So, I guess, Mary or Dave, as you look at your shoppers that are converting to multichannel, does that channel migration happen from store to web or vice versa? Are you seeing any change in where how the customers discover you? And then just quickly for Scott, how much did the Indiana DC weigh on gross margins this quarter and then what's the right way to think about the ongoing impacts from the DC is to margins? Thanks.
Mary N. Dillon - Chief Executive Officer & Director
I'll start with the cross-channel, maybe Dave add, if there is anything I miss here. But cross-channel shopping is actually a pretty small percent of our shopper base today, it's only about 6% of our guests or so. And we love them, because the cross-channel shopper is shopping more frequently and spending more than a single channel shopper by far. I would say that â you can think about digital as the center of pretty much everything now, right? So quite often maybe somebody is discovering and researching online before they come into the store, whether they discover us online or in-store, first, I'm not sure if I can break that up, but I'd say probably mostly in-store.
Online tends to be very incremental to us as well. Our guests love the experience of coming to the store, the whole beauty enthusiasts' vibe is about trying things and increasingly experiencing services, and then online she find things that are kind of incremental to perhaps what she even had time to discover. We push out lots of emails, not lots, appropriate number of emails to our guests around new and exclusive and exciting products and that has stimulated some online shopping as well. So to your premise about, will that be a big area of growth for us in the future? Absolutely.
David C. Kimbell - Chief Merchandising and Marketing Officer
And as far as the new distribution center is concerned, again as Mary stated, we're very happy with the performance the team put in there, getting it off the ground successfully. And you recall that third quarter was really the first time we had it in service.
So it was less of a drag on gross profit margin in the fourth quarter, because the building was operating very effectively. And as we look towards 2016, again we will have headwinds in the first half of the year because of Greenwood being online, wasn't there last year, it's still going to continue to scale up. And in the second half of the year we're going to start â we'll see more benefits there as we lap Greenwood, but then we'll be taking online the new Dallas DC. So you're going to have incremental headwinds there. So as we look ahead next year, it's going to be fairly challenging, I would say, from a supply chain contribution perspective, but we do expect to see merchandise margins continue to expand, so there'll be a bit of a help there overall at the gross profit line.
Simeon A. Siegel - Nomura Securities International, Inc.

Our next question comes from Mike Baker with Deutsche Bank. Please state your question.
Mike Baker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Hi. Thanks. I guess I'll follow-up from my one question, I'll follow-up on the Clinique and LancÃ´me rollout. So about 700 stores now. I mean, that's up pretty substantially. I think the last time I have numbers was 2013 where they were in about a 100 each. So it's clearly rolled out pretty quickly in 2014 and 2015 and likely a big comp driver, but with it in now what about â let's say, about 80% of your stores should â is the lift from that going to potentially slow over the next couple of years?
David C. Kimbell - Chief Merchandising and Marketing Officer
Let me clarify what I said earlier, kind of repeat that. The 700 stores number was specifically about Benefit. So, that's the Benefit boutiques at the end of last year. Of course, you know, with our Benefit, we have services. We do Benefit Brow Bar that's in those stores. What I've said about Clinique and LancÃ´me is, you remember, 100 stores that had grown by the end of last year to about 200 stores each. And...
Mike Baker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Okay. I said â okay.
Scott M. Settersten - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer and Assistant Secretary
And then â so that's where we are on those brands, roughly speaking. And then, the 500 boutique number is a combination of additions in new stores and existing stores of Benefit, Clinique and LancÃ´me. We won't kind of talk specifically about any one of them, but in total, across those three brands, in both new stores and existing stores, we'll be adding about 500 boutiques.
Mike Baker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Understood. Right. Yeah. So, since I got that completely wrong, let me ask one another question. You didn't â my fault, I wrote down the wrong number. You didn't talk about the small stores at all. So can you just update us on how that's going? Thanks.
Mary N. Dillon - Chief Executive Officer & Director
Sure. I appreciate you humiliated many when you get something wrong. Anyways, on the small stores, I guess, I would just say stepping back, we have, as you know, two small stores that we opened up in small markets of Vernal, Utah and Morganton, North Carolina, both are performing fine.
The most important thing is we're learning a lot about operating a smaller footprint and as we look into the future, a couple of things, I would say. One is that we know that smaller markets, like those markets, there is plenty of them out there and they offer another growth opportunity for us. Having said that, we could do 10,000 square foot stores, maybe even easier, because it's even better representation of the full brand experience. So, we're kind of getting similar experience in small markets. Those stores are doing well.
You'll also see â the other thing is that, as we look out in the future, we've not yet sized or put any kind of target out there on other opportunities like, say, urban stores or maybe the downtown â main street parts of, say, suburbs across the country where there smaller parcels of real estate.
So, as we continue to refresh our real estate view in â we're always doing that â if we decide to go after smaller stores, we'll have a lot better handle on what that looks like in terms of how we think about season (47:24) spacing assortments, the labor model and supply chain model. So all good learnings and I've seen it showing (47:32) consistently and we like to kind of a walk before we run. So, we're walking and learning and it's going to provide benefits for us in the future.
Mike Baker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Understood. All right. Thanks for the color.
Mary N. Dillon - Chief Executive Officer & Director

Our next question comes from Dana Telsey with Telsey Advisory group. Please state your question.
Dana L. Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group LLC
Thank you. Good afternoon and congratulations. Sorry about that before. Thoughts on the mall stores, how you're thinking about the mall and opening stores in malls? And then, also, with the success of services, how are the margins on services? And is there opportunity there? And just lastly, any thoughts on the timeframe of the accelerated share repurchase? Thank you.
Mary N. Dillon - Chief Executive Officer & Director
Three questions in one.
Dana L. Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group LLC
I know.
Mary N. Dillon - Chief Executive Officer & Director
Okay. We have a mic and (48:16) get together run with it (48:18). So, mall stores are a small percentage of what we do today, but we have a fair â about 10% of our stores. And we are very selective about when we should open up in malls. And we're very â I think we understand that model well. There are certain markets, where that's an excellent piece of the real estate and we've got a lot of learnings about â even where inside the mall, how to think about where we're positioned and who are positioned by, where the â how the doors open, et cetera. So we'll continue â I don't ever expect that it will become any much bigger than it is, but certainly, we do not reject that, if we feel like it's going to give us the kind of return that we need. So, think about that as a smallish, I guess, opportunity going forward, but part of the mix. Okay, that's malls. Number two?
Dana L. Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group LLC
Service margins.
Mary N. Dillon - Chief Executive Officer & Director
Service margins. What was â I'm sorry. Go ahead.
Dana L. Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group LLC
Is that â how do you think about margins on services and the opportunity?
Scott M. Settersten - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer and Assistant Secretary
Yeah.
Mary N. Dillon - Chief Executive Officer & Director
Oh. Okay. Yeah, I mean, I would say we don't break out the margins specifically across the business, because of the labor involved, the margin on service is typically going to be lower than margin on retail products. That guest though who's coming to use services is going to be spending 2.5 times more than somebody who is not, so â and buying a lot of retail products, coming frequently. So, in total, it's very incremental in terms of profitability to our business model.
Dana L. Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group LLC
Okay.
Scott M. Settersten - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer and Assistant Secretary
And to close out on the ASR, we're very happy to be able to announce that today. Again that would typically will begin as soon as the open window for us occurs, which is early part of next week. In that sizing, we would expect to be able to execute that over a course of 30 days, 45 days, roughly.

Our next question comes from Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer. Please state your question.
Rupesh Parikh - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)
Thanks for taking my question and congrats on a really nice quarter. So, I just wanted to go back to your CapEx spend. We're seeing a lift this year in CapEx and you guys called out some of the reasons with the boutique expansions and additional fixtures, et cetera. I just want to I guess ask how do you think about the returns on investments related to these investments or fixtures, boutiques and even some of the refreshes?
Scott M. Settersten - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer and Assistant Secretary
Well, we feel very confident that it's a good way to invest money. We've had experience â again, Mary mentioned, we crawl, walk, run. I mean that's way we operate here. So, whether it's the new fragrance fixture that we referred to, we already have that installed in a number of stores. We've monitored the results there, both from a sales and margin perspective, but also from a shrink perspective, right, it's always a 360 degree view.
As far as the boutiques are concerned, again, we've had a long history there with a number of these brand partners and we've been able to measure incrementality and halo effect and all those other things, when these are installed in our stores. So, we're very confident that they're going to produce excellent returns for investors over the long-term.

Our next question comes from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Please state your question.
Simeon Ari Gutman - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Thanks. Good afternoon. Congratulations. Just two, I'll make them very quick. The first, Mary, you said that the five-year guidance is all about saving tax (51:25). Thinking about investments, right, we had two big years of investments, this being the second one. Is there any â how should we think about, I guess, next year, the out year, 2017, should we see the taper-off? And second question, it's one of those quarters, Mary, I think it's fair to ask, what's not going right in the business?
Mary N. Dillon - Chief Executive Officer & Director
What's not going right? Interesting question, Simeon. Here is the thing, we're really focused on the future, and where the world is going in the next, I mean, maybe I'll be so bold to say five years or 10 years. But thinking about what are the innovations and/or ways to think about the way that â way to think guest expectation is going to continue to evolve the change about seamless retailing and shopping.
So, it's not a problem, it's a great opportunity for us, because if â and I talked about this in the script, but I've got a team of people and their teams that think in a very integrated guest-centric way and store associate-centric way. So, we're thinking a lot about how do we think about just continuing to be ahead of the curve as it relates to the competitive environment in the shopping expectations of the future. So â and there is no one answer to that, I guess. So, it's not like it's anything is broken, it's a matter of where do we point ourselves to the future. And I mean that honestly. I think that â I'm very, very pleased at how many things are going well. We're not complacent about that. We push ourselves very hard. We are really focused on always improving.
Scott M. Settersten - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer and Assistant Secretary
As far as the CapEx and long-term guidance implications are concerned, Simeon, I mean, we're very happy with where we are today. I mean the business is performing very strong. We're probably â we're a little bit ahead of where we thought we would be at this point in time. The boutiques were in our five-year guidance, I mean they were inherently built in there, but we are pulling them forward. So, there is an acceleration here. We expect â again those investments, we've demonstrated that they pay great dividends for investors over the long term.
So, the CapEx, specifically for next year, you can expect it to stay elevated. This boutique â the strategy we have in place with our brand partners is a multi-year rollout. So, we're going to touch as many of our comp stores. And again, that's what that $80 million is basically referring to is our existing store base. So, try to touch as many of those over the next couple years as we can.

Our next question comes from Matthew Fassler with Goldman Sachs. Please state your question.
Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Thanks so much, and good afternoon. My first question â I'm going to ask a couple of follow-ups on topics that have come up. You talked about small stores, you didn't explicitly address store capacity. I think 1,200 stores is the number that you've had out there in the past. You will be at 900 stores at some point in the second quarter, adding 100 stores per year and the productivity looks terrific. There's no signs of saturation whatsoever, based on all those numbers. Any updated thinking on capacity as we think about the size of your outlook here?
Mary N. Dillon - Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yeah. Thank you, Matt. No, I'd reiterate what we said, which is that and you just recapped it, 1,200 stores full size, kind of prototypical, we see a very clear line of sight to that. We've also said that, beyond that, the small market opportunity probably represents another couple hundred stores. We are in the process of refreshing our real estate view and we're going to start to take a more specific look at the opportunities beyond that, so urban or downtown, suburban type pieces of real estate. So, I guess, I'd just say stay tuned on that. We'll continue to refresh that view.
But I feel very optimistic about our ability to continue to drive market share growth. So whether it's in terms of square footage or at a comp basis, we have â if you step way back, we have only 5% share of the spending of the beauty enthusiasts today in the U.S. and it's â beauty is highly fragmented, you can buy beauty products in thousands and thousands of places across the country, so we know that we've hit a sweet spot with the group that's actually, frankly, really, strong and growing in terms of the beauty enthusiast segment.
So, we're differentiated. They like us. So we're never going to get complacent about building out too much, but we certainly don't want to underestimate the other possibility here. So, I feel good about the targets that we've communicated. If that changes, certainly, we'll refresh that, but we're continuing looking at â the other thing I'd say is that â reiterate, new store productivity very strong, cannibalization very low, too low to even be material and it's actually gotten less, which is great.
And I'd like to mention that the real estate opportunities, very strong out there for us. And everything we just talked about as it relates to driving brand awareness of Ulta only helps. Every store that we open now, we've got people who kind of know more about the brand than they did a couple of years ago. So, I think all those factors are very positive for us.
Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Great. And if I could follow up briefly with Scott on gross margin, you're coming off a massive increase. And I just want to understand a couple of the moving pieces that drive your gross margin outlook, that D&A and write-off piece is that significant, because it just seems like that would ultimately be non-recurring? Also, Dallas versus Greenwood, just in terms of relative impact? And then finally, shouldn't mix, as it did this quarter, help you overcome a lot of those factors?
Scott M. Settersten - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer and Assistant Secretary
Yeah. I guess that the one thing I would say right off the bat is we're batting 1.000 here, right? I mean we've had a pretty good run in the last few quarters and you can't always plan for everything to go perfectly every quarter. So, as we look out towards 2016, I mean the combination of the DCs, we feel very confident now. We executed very well in Greenwood. We expect to do as good or better with Dallas coming online next year. Again, I won't break out basis points of headwinds or tailwinds from each one of those, but directionally, we feel very confident that these are going to deliver the kind of benefits that we expected upfront and that we described back in our Investor Day presentations.
I'd mentioned merchandise margins a little earlier here. Again, the core â the mix of the business is very strong in retail. All these new brands that are coming in were â we've got generally a very strong terms with our vendors, pulling back on some of the broad discounting things and doing things more directly focused with our customers that are only going to help drive merchandise margins higher in the future. So, net-net, we feel very confident that we're going to deliver, at least, flattish next year and we're hoping that we're going to be able to do better, similar to what we did in 2015.
Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co.

Our next question comes from Oliver Chen with Cowen and Company. Please state your question.
Courtney Willson - Cowen & Co. LLC
Hi. This is Courtney Willson in for Oliver tonight. Thanks for taking our question. We're just wondering, of those 100 new stores expected to open next year, are they weighted towards new or existing markets. And then also, we're just wondering what you're seeing going forward on the promotional front and if the promotional cadence differs at all in the mass versus prestige categories. Thanks.
Scott M. Settersten - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer and Assistant Secretary
Yeah. Let me start off with the mix. So, next year, basically new versus existing is getting consistent with kind of where we've been in the last couple of years. It's about 70% existing, 30% new. The one place we are seeing a bit of a change is in the types of centers. So, new centers versus existing centers, so it's still â the last couple of years, it's been 80/20 existing, 70/30 existing. Next year, we see a kind of ticking down a little bit to 60% existing center, versus 40% new. So, that's a great sign. We have new developments coming out of the ground.
David C. Kimbell - Chief Merchandising and Marketing Officer
Sure. And on the promotional front, we've talked about some of the gradual changes that we've made and trying to rely less on broad couponing and discounting to more targeted, and leveraging our loyalty program as a source of value for our guests. And we're going to continue to do that. We're not going to make any wild swings in 2016, but we will continue down that path. As far as mass and prestige there, each of those categories are very different in how they promote. But â so we tend to have more promotions on the mass side, of course. Prestige is not â that's not tend to be a promoted category. Although, starting on Sunday, Courtney, is our 21 Days of Beauty event, beauty's biggest event. So, it is one of the two times a year, where you can get pretty consistent prestige promotion. So that will be something we'll continue, focused events like that.

Hi. Can you hear me okay?
Mary N. Dillon - Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yes, Dan.
Daniel H. Hofkin - William Blair & Co. LLC
All right. I'll add my congrats once again. Just a couple â one clarification question back to the gross margin in the quarter versus the year-over-year trend in earlier quarters. Just, it sounds like mix was generally kind of similarly strong. But just given the gross margin, along with comp, was so much better than expected, was there â what would you call out as â was it less promotion? Was it â was the mix better year-over-year than it was in earlier quarters? What were the, I guess, things there? Was it the DC having ramped up? And then, I have just one question about not 2016 but 2017.
Scott M. Settersten - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer and Assistant Secretary
Yeah. I guess, the answer to the first part of your question, yes. I mean, it was â again, it wasn't any one thing, Dan, it was a total team effort in the fourth quarter. Stores, e-commerce team, DCs, merchants, planning, everybody in the corporate support area just really executed at a very, very high level. The merchants picked the winners, the store teams did a great job selling gift cards, e-commerce mix was better than ever, things that we have been telling investors, we're going to improve on, the mix overall was good. Just the improved focus on giving the customer what she wants, right, so, pulling back and being more focused on some of the discounting tactics that we used. And overall â and the DCs just â and the work that our teams put in this year, it's not only to get Greenwood open, but to improve the existing buildings was just beyond what we expected. So, it was just really spectacular performance, overall.
Daniel H. Hofkin - William Blair & Co. LLC
Great. And then, as it relates to next year and, I think, you have an extra selling week like a lot of companies in 2017, if I'm not mistaken, a 53rd week. But if you put that aside, are you still thinking that we might even see a little bit of acceleration in earnings growth next year with some of the investments spending, sort of, normalizing or tailing off a little bit?
Scott M. Settersten - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer and Assistant Secretary
Yeah. Our 53rd week is actually the following year. It's going to be 2017. So, just to make sure...
Daniel H. Hofkin - William Blair & Co. LLC
Right.
Scott M. Settersten - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer and Assistant Secretary
...the system there. Yeah. So for, 2016, now are you referencing acceleration or...
Daniel H. Hofkin - William Blair & Co. LLC
Sorry, I was asking about the year that you have not specifically guided to. I was just thinking most of us model out the year. And I think originally in your plan, you were thinking 2015 and 2016 were going to be flattish margin years and then possibly you starting to increase again beginning in 2017, is that still the way you're thinking about that?
Scott M. Settersten - Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer and Assistant Secretary
Yeah, that is. It's consistent. I think Mary mentioned earlier, we're not changing our long-term guidance. We feel confident in the trajectory of the business. We think there is a lot of benefits coming out of these supply chain investments that we're making today. So, merchandise mix going up, supply chain efficiency is kicking in in a meaningful way in 2017. We feel very confident that we're on target.
