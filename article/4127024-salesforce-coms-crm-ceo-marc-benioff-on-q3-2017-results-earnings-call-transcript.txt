Good afternoon. My name is Doris, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Salesforce Q3 Fiscal 2018 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.
I will now turn the call over to our host Mr. John Cummings, SVP of Investor Relations. Sir, please go ahead.
John Cummings
Thanks so much, Doris. Good afternoon, everyone. And thanks for joining us for our fiscal third quarter 2018 results conference call. Our third quarter results press release, SEC filings and a replay of today's call can be found on our IR website at www.salesforce.com/investor. With me on the call today is Marc Benioff, Chairman and CEO; Keith Block, Vice Chairman, President and COO; Mark Hawkins, President and CFO and also joining us today is Bret Taylor, President and Chief Product Officer.
As a reminder, our commentary today will primarily be in non-GAAP terms. Reconciliations between our GAAP and non-GAAP results and guidance can be found in our earnings press release. Also, some of our comments today may contain forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Should any of these materialize or should our assumptions prove to be incorrect, actual Company results could differ materially from these forward-looking statements. A description of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions and other factors that could affect our financial results are included in our SEC filings including our most recent report on Form 10-Q.
So with that, let me turn the call over to Marc Benioff.
Marc Benioff
Well thank you so much, John, and thank you to everyone attending today's earnings call. As we all are getting together here and gathering for the call during the Thanksgiving week, this is definitely a unique time. And I just want to especially say on behalf of everybody at Salesforce that we are much to be grateful for. We're certainly aware especially now that we have more responsibility to focus on helping others and that was especially felt by all of us at Dreamforce.
Honestly that's why our thoughts remain so deeply with the victims and those who have lost their homes, just this quarter in hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria and the 6,000 families in our local bay area who have lost their homes in the tragic wildfires. And we know that is especially difficult as we head into the holidays.
Salesforce with the help of 80 companies in solidarity on these efforts is really doing its part. And less than two weeks ago with the Band Together concert held in San Francisco during Dreamforce we with all of you helped to raise $17 million for the fire victims with the 100% of the funds going directly to the families affected. And I wanted to say thank you to all of you for helping out on that.
After Thanksgiving, we are going to announce another very exciting new program and I will ask all of you to help me in raising even more money for these families who have lost everything. So, thanks again to all of you who have contributed so much and thank you to your support in the future as well.
Now as we move on, I wanted to say that we've been able to do well in our business while hoping those less fortunate than us and to that end we are now going to talk about the results for the third quarter, which were record for Salesforce.
Revenue rose to nearly $2.7 billion up 25% and that was just incredible. We are organically adding the revenue of most other cloud companies now every year and you can see that as we start to give little guidance for next year.
We have nearly $15.9 billion in booked business on and off the balance sheet, that's up 31% from a year ago. In fact we added more than $3.8 billion to this balance since last year and based on these strong results, we're raising our full year top-line revenue guidance by $40 million to $10.44 billion at the high end of the range, 24% growth this year and delivering durable top and bottom-line well into the future. And I think if you look back to where we were a year ago when we first gave guidance for this year, we've dramatically improved what we thought we were going to be able to do and it's really a thanks to our incredible team at Salesforce and to all of our customers and partners as well.
Now looking ahead, we told you Dreamforce for next year, we're now guiding revenue to $12.5 billion, this is at the high end of our range and I'm especially proud that Fortune magazine just ranked Salesforce number one on its inaugural future 50 list of companies best positioned for breakout growth and we're very excited about that recognition that we've received and other recognition from them as well just this week.
In fact as the fastest growing enterprise software company ever to reach $10 billion, we are now targeting to grow the company organically to more than $20 billion by fiscal year 2022 and we plan to do that to be the fastest enterprise software company ever to get to $20 billion. And as we continue on this path, we're going to invest in a new generation of leaders at Salesforce to continue to power our growth and that's why I'm so excited to make this announcement that we have a tremendous promotion Bret Taylor is taking on the role of President and Chief Product Officer and Alex Dayon has been, also promoted to the position of President and Chief Strategy Officer.
Both of these tremendous executives are now reporting directly to me and are really critical part of our management team. And in these new roles Bret is going to drive our product vision, design, development, go-to-market strategy and Alex is going to lead strategic initiatives working more closely with our customers on product direction and transformation. And I'm sure everyone on this call would agree as that we are fortune to have two amazing leaders at Salesforce to help us lead this next wave.
And Bret is in the room with us and we're going to talk to him in a second, Alex is on vacation in Asia with his family, but we are just thrilled for both of them. In closing, I'd just want to appreciate everything that you have done for all of us. We appreciate everything that and know-how how hard all of you work to make Salesforce successful as well. And also thank you for coming to Dreamforce, we want to send all of our best wishes to your families for happy Thanksgiving.
And with that, I'm going to turn it over to Keith.
Keith Block
Thanks Marc and thanks again for joining us during Thanksgiving week. We appreciate that very much, it was great to be with so many of you at our Investor Day just a few weeks ago at Dreamforce and those of you who were there saw first time the power of the platform to connect companies and their customers, the energy of our Trailblazers in our deep commitment to giving back to our communities as Marc as talked about. And as Marc said, we are clearly building a company for the ages.
Our Q3 results were outstanding and that's because everyday Salesforce is helping more and more companies transform and connect with their customers in a whole new way. Our customers want to deliver next generation experiences with their customers who are always on, always connected. And to do this, they need a unified CRM platform and that's what Salesforce is all about. They want industry leading products and sales and service and marketing and commerce and more and that's what we've delivered. We've also delivered innovations like Einstein Lightning and Trailhead that elevate the entire platform. No other enterprise technology company in the world is delivering innovation at this scale.
And that's why so many companies including Hilton, DuPont and ASTACar are turning to Salesforce as their trusted partner in digital transformation. In addition to delivering these innovative solutions, we continue to fuel our growth through international expansion, speaking the language of our customers and growing our partner ecosystem.
Now as we discussed in Investor Day, we are increasing our investment in our international go-to-market resources or operations, or infrastructure to deliver the highest quality service to our customers around the world. We've increased our international headcount nearly 30% annually since FY 2014 and year-to-date nearly 40% of new hires have been made outside the Americas.
In the quarter, Salesforce also went live on AWS in Sydney in Australia, where we recently we're named the number one CRM provider by Gartner. And Amazon continues to be a key partner in our international expansion and a very large customer.
Now speaking of Australia, I'm very excited on Q3, we expanded our relationship with National Australia Bank one of the country's largest financial services institutions and as you may recall, we closed the significant deal with AMP last quarter, so clearly we've got great momentum in financial services in Australia in our broader APAC region.
We had another very strong quarter in Japan, deepening our relationships with Hitachi, Seven & i, Ebara and Mitsui Sumitomo Insurance, APAC continues to be one of our fastest growing regions with 27% growth in constant currency in Q3.
In EMEA, we grew 33% in constant currency and in the quarter we expanded relationships with marquee brands including BP and Group PSA, the second largest automotive group in Europe. We also formed a new relationship with another leading car manufacturer in Europe and they're going wall-to-wall with Salesforce to manage every aspect of the customer journey from marketing to sales to service.
In Q3, we significantly expanded our relationship with the leading global telecommunications company also headquartered in Europe that is leveraging the Salesforce platform to attract new business, simplify payment to vendors and get a 360 degree view of their customers.
So, it's pretty clear that our international investments are paying off. Now around the world, speaking the language of our customers is giving us incredible momentum, in fact 57% of customers who buy our industry products are brand new to Salesforce. And in Q3 we launched the financial services cloud for retail banking to enable banks to deliver highly personalized intelligent and connected banking experiences for their consumers.
We also deepened relationships with PNC, KeyBanc and ING one of the largest financial institutions in the world. ING is expanding with Salesforce globally to meet their goal of becoming a one platform bank. In fact today 17 of the top 20 U.S. and European banks rely on Salesforce. So, we continue to see momentum in other areas including health and life sciences, last quarter I mentioned that 15 of the world's 20 largest pharmaceutical companies rely on Salesforce. And this quarter, we added another marquee customer to that list and incredibly we deepened our relationships with 13 of those firms.
We also expanded our relationship with Anthem one of the largest health insurers in the United States. And in Q3, we closed one of our largest public sector deals to-date with the Department of Homeland Security; this follows a large transaction with the VA last quarter.
With respect to retail, the holiday season is the most important time of the year as we all know and three years from now Black Friday is expected to be the busiest digital shopping day in the U.S. history. I'm sure we will all participate in that.
With the addition of commerce cloud and Salesforce DMP to our portfolio we now have an incredible BDC platform that enables our customers to deliver brand experiences that are seamless, connected and personalized and that's why international cosmetics retailer LUXit On has chosen commerce cloud to replace their home grown ecommerce solution to accelerate their global growth.
And finally, as you may have seen Dreamforce Adidas deepened their relationship with Salesforce in Q3 to drive their global expansion deliver a hyper-personalized experience that today's customers all expect.
Our partner ecosystem continues to expand as more than half of the new business today is generated few partners and Salesforce is the highest growth practice for the top systems integrators and this was not the case just a few years ago and we continue to build deeper more strategic relationships with our partners.
At Dreamforce, we announced the new strategic partnership with Google and that was to connect Google Apps and analytics with Salesforce making our customers even smarter and more productive. We also selected Google Cloud platform as a preferred public cloud provider and Google of course runs their business on Salesforce.
So in closing, I want to express my gratitude to our customers, our partners, our employees for their continued trust in us and I want to wish those of you in the United States a very, very happy Thanksgiving.
So, I would like to turn the call over to Mark Hawkins, who will outline our financial execution in Q3. Mark?
Mark Hawkins
Great. Thanks Keith.
As you've heard from Marc and Keith and as you've seen in our Q3 results, we delivered another quarter of outstanding growth. At Salesforce we deliver customer success and help our customers grow, in turn Salesforce grows as well and that's what we saw in the third quarter.
Revenue grew 25% in dollars and 23% in constant currency excluding a year-over-year FX tailwind of $39 million. We also saw a sequential FX tailwind to revenue of $12 million. We delivered a strong year-over-year subscription and support revenue growth across each of our clouds in the third quarter.
Sales cloud continued its strong growth at 17%, service cloud reaccelerated to the quarter to 25%, platform and other also accelerated to 34%, marketing cloud including commerce cloud grew 40% and keep in mind this growth is organic as it's the first full quarter comparison with commerce cloud in the base period.
Commerce cloud contributed $64 million in subscription and support revenue. Dollar attrition for the third quarter which is now including marketing cloud was approximately 10%, which is flat from a year-on-year basis. We expanded our third quarter non-GAAP operating margin by 360 basis points year-over-year driven by improvements in sales and marketing and G&A.
Non-GAAP EPS was $0.39 up 63% over last year, operating cash flow was $126 million down 18% year-over-year. Our third quarter operating cash flow result was impacted basically by continued invoice and seasonality and the timing of Dreamforce and given the strength of the quarter higher commission payouts.
Deferred revenue ended the quarter at $4.39 billion up 26% in dollars and 24% in constant currency excluding the FX tailwind of $60 million. On a sequential basis deferred revenue benefited from an FX tailwind of $4 million.
This strong Q3 result was driven by deals closing earlier than we had anticipated. Before moving on to guidance, I would like to update you on the status of the adoption of the new and revised accounting standards including ASC 606, ASC 340, ASC 2016-01 all of which will be adopted on February 1, 2018.
Regarding ASC 606 the new revenue recognition standard, we expect the impact of the opening balance sheet as of February 1, 2016 due to the recast of revenues to be immaterial. We're still working to determine the impact to revenue after the opening balance sheet. For ASC 340, the commission accounting standard, the new standard will require us to capitalize more cost such as payroll tax and amortize there more longer period than we do today.
For new business we expect to amortize the commissions over 4 year period rather than over the contract term. ASC 2016-01 which addresses the fair market value of accounting for venture fund investments may result in greater, variability in the [OIE] [ph] line of our P&L due to changes in market prices in our publicly held investments and the timing of additional rounds of financing for a privately held investments. It's important to know that these standards will not have an impact for operating cash flow.
Moving on to guidance, we are raising our full year 2018 revenue guidance to $10.43 billion to $10.44 billion for 24% year-over-year growth. We're also raising our FY 2018 GAAP diluted EPS guidance to $0.12 to $0.13 and non-GAAP diluted EPS guidance to $1.32 to $1.33.
We remain on track to deliver the 125 to 150 basis points of non-GAAP operating margin improvement in FY 2018. We're also maintaining our full year operating cash flow guidance of 20% to 21% year-over-year.
For Q4, we're expecting revenue of $2.801 billion to $2.811 billion, GAAP diluted EPS of $0.03 to $0.04 and non-GAAP diluted EPS of $0.32 to $0.33 and year-over-year deferred revenue growth of 19% to 20%. Please note as part of the adoption of ASC 606 we will be providing a roll forward schedule of billed deferred revenue along with additional disclosures for unbilled deferred revenue in that context we do not expect to provide deferred revenue guidance going forward.
And as you've heard at Dreamforce we initiated revenue guidance for fiscal 2019 of $12.45 billion to $12.5 billion based on the current accounting standard. And as a reminder, we will provide operating cash flow, EPS and non-GAAP operating margin guidance for FY 2019 when we release our Q4 results in February.
To close, we delivered a very strong financial results in Q3 and I would like to thank all of our trailblazers, our employees, our customers, our investors and the communities that we serve for their continued support and wish all of you an enjoyable holiday season.
And with that, I'd like to open up the call for questions. Operator?
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs.
Heather Bellini
Great, thank you. I was just wondering if you could just share a little bit, looking at the trends in your marketing cloud business. What do you see as the key drivers of that business accelerating like it has been and what do you, I guess one of the other things you commented that now your attrition rate includes marketing cloud. So, and that's 10% is that the rate we should be thinking if kind of normalized going forward? Thank you.
Marc Benioff
Well, let me take the first of that and then I'll turn it over to Mark Hawkins to comment on the attrition rate and how he is calculating them.
I think we saw Dreamforce really speaks to this question and I tried to address this in my opening comments Dreamforce. But I had so many incredible experiences with customers, but especially in the last six months. And I'll tell you that when we look at the transformations that our customers are going through all of them are trying to connect with their customers in incredible new ways, but for many of those companies it means that they themselves have to transform and go through what we call this digital transformation.
But for so many of these customers this digital transformation really begins with the customer and I think you can look at Ducati where we profiled at Salesforce and at Dreamforce when we look at what is going on with them, here is an incredible product, they have an incredible community, they have the ability to directly connect with them through the product. And this is transforming Ducati that's why they would come to Dreamforce and have their CEO there and have their bikes there and show how that they don't just have motorcycles, they've got connected motorcycles. That is all driven by the marketing cloud. It's a one-on-one relationship between Ducati and the consumer, the community, the commerce, the one-on-one, the ability to have messaging in our direct interactions.
I think that every company is becoming this, I don't care if it's a B2B company or B2C company, every company is becoming B2B to B2C company and that is driving this forward. And I think if you saw the huge innovation that happened at Dreamforce the marketing cloud especially in regards to journey builder and other aspects. And this is actually great way actually for me to leverage now and to introduce Bret Taylor, who is our new Chief Product Officer who is sitting at the table here with us. And Bret you and I were just talking yesterday about the huge innovation that's coming in the marketing cloud and it is driving this amazing growth. So, can you just touch on that?
Bret Taylor
Yes, sure. I mean the trend we're seeing with so many customers like Marc mentioned is not just being a B2B company or B2C company, but sometimes both whether its Ducati connecting with our customers or customers that sell directly and sell to distributors and what I really think is so powerful about the Salesforce platform is, we're the one CRM platform that can do both whether a B2B company which is where we started or you are a B2C company doing traditional marketing through our marketing cloud or you are company that the hybrid the reason our vendors -- reason our partners are choosing us as the vendor is because we offer a platform they can do both now, and also grow them in the future. And that's really unique in these capabilities truly provide that single view of customer whether or not you they bought their product directly or indirectly. And it's something I think it's the really strategic advantage for our product line and the area that we're investing in primarily.
Mark Hawkins
Okay. Let me just jump into the tail-end of that question Heather, also I mean obviously the marketing cloud was completely covered. In terms of the attrition rate, we've had core attrition that we've been reporting, we added on also marketing cloud and Pardot is part of the -- as we keep integrating the different acquisitions and that trend is been flat year-on-year. So, in aggregate, the more aggregated number taken a core plus added in the marketing cloud and Pardot is 10% and its stable year-on-year.
Operator
Our next question is from the line of Mark Murphy with JPMorgan.
Mark Murphy
Yes. Thank you very much and congratulations on a strong quarter.
My question is for Marc Benioff, most of your CRM competitors are still relying on the older on-premise technologies or hybrid technologies. And so you had said recently that AI is going to be the future, do you think those on-premise technologies could suffer a bit just from inability to handle AI if they can't kind of tap into the reservoir of data in the scalable compute capacity to power those algorithms in the way that Salesforce can?
And I also wanted to ask you if you mentioned closing one of your largest public sector deals the Homeland Security, do you think the federal government has finally reaching the tipping point where its adoption of cloud and Salesforce is going to begin to move faster?
Marc Benioff
Well, I'd say I'm going to tip that question actually to Bret if that's all right with you, because I think that he could really address specifically this kind of -- what's happening with AI obviously we've had a tremendous year with Salesforce with AI since releasing Einstein a year ago and now just releasing My Einstein at Dreamforce. We have seen an incredible advancement in Artificial Intelligence, you said our customers and I think you saw us well in the example I gave in my keynote of Coco Cola cooler and the dramatic advances that we can make with technology like that using Einstein vision what it means. And I think the speed that we are delivering and on-boarding these customers with Artificial Intelligence especially in decorative model that this is demonstrated to them the lot of the advantages of going to the cloud, but let me tip it to Bret for his perspective.
Bret Taylor
Yes. I think the question was spot on, I think the Artificial Intelligence in the future is we're launching with Einstein perfectly capture the power of the cloud. Previously our customers don't need to buy new hardware with every release they get these new capabilities automatically. And that is the power of the cloud. We are constantly re-architecting our systems to incorporate the latest and greatest technologies that are customers can use to transform their businesses. And because it's based on the cloud, it's just too simple turning them on. And as Marc mentioned, it's not just cloud and on-premise also the way we package them. You heard a lot about at Dreamforce about trailblazers and what this means to us is taking these technologies and enabling our customers to use them with Clicks Not Code and fundamentally our vision is to broaden the base of people who can adopt these new technologies within their companies, beyond just computer programmers and experts and data scientist, but anyone with the domain expertise in their industry can actually adopt these new technologies. I think the combination of that decorative platform that Marc mentioned and that focus on Clicks Not Code combined with the benefits of the Rowe's abilities that the cloud is truly unique to Salesforce in the CRM market.
Keith Block
Mark this is Keith. So just to follow-up on the second part of that question which is really about the public sector. I do believe we are reaching a tipping point, this is an initiative certainly in this country where the modernization of technology within the governments has been discussed, I would argue that it, it was launched really under the Obama administration in fact one of our former employees was a CIO as you know the federal government who was really one of the people who led the effort of cloud first, which is very important. But now we're seeing increased momentum around this digital transformation. The deal that we signed with the Department of Homeland Security is certainly an indication of the modernization the government, this is on the hills of the VA that we did last quarter, in fact I had the opportunity spend quite a bit of time with the VA folks at Dreamforce. And you know some agencies are ahead of others, I think Homeland Security is ahead of some of the others thankfully I think we would all say, but I think it is the beginning of the public sector kind of catching up to where the private sector has been going for a quite few years now. So it is pretty exciting around the transformation.
Operator
Our next question is from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley.
Keith Weiss
Thank you guys for taking the question and congratulations on a really strong Q3. Question for Keith and a follow-up for Mr. Hawkins. Keith, you used a phrase wall-to-wall deals, describing one of the deal that you got signed in this quarter, how prevalent has that become and in sort of what you guys are selling today and what's in your pipeline, how often are guys going for a sort of across the board the entire suite? And then kind of related for Mark Hawkins, this was a really strong quarter ahead of its, the seasonality that we've seen in prior years and these big deals have been pushing more and more business into the Q4, was Q3 a normal in terms of sort of going get that seasonality or are we seeing just more back-half business overall perhaps not all in Q4?
Keith Block
Okay. So, let me take the first part of that and obviously Mark can respond to it. So wall-to-wall really means a multi-cloud deal it's a solution that means it includes sales, service, marketing cloud community, analytics, Einstein et cetera, depending on whether it's a B2B customer or B2C customer may include commerce cloud and DMP. So, as you know our selling motion is to initially establish a beachhead with sales cloud, which is typically a leading indicator of new logos.
And we will paint a vision of transformation and then customer will start with a deployment of sales cloud and then we expand out to the right and that would typically include sales cloud to service clouds and marketing cloud et cetera to platform. More and more customers are deepening their relationships with us and its becoming more and more strategic round embracing there is notion of digital transformation which again means more multi-cloud solutions.
And certainly, the strategic relationships that we extended this quarter or established this new, are indication of satisfying that requirement and painting a vision for those customers and driving intangible business benefit. Mark, I'll hand over to you.
Mark Hawkins
Yes I'm sure, let me jump into the seasonality, I think Keith, I think you make a really good point, the first line that gives you context when you see this persisted trend about evolving seasonality as you are touching on and at the same time its informed at any given period and any given quarter about what happened in that quarter and we had a very strong quarter as we talked about. And it's evidenced by our total DR guide 31% in aggregate and you can see the delta even to what our prediction was earlier. So very strong Q3 2018 and then you put that in just to position to, when you look at Q4 and last year's very, very tough compare and that just adds a little bit of context which is why the DR guide make sense 20% at the high end after applying that context.
So that, I think the pattern is persistent, but this context with a very, very strong Q3 and a tough Q4 compare, we feel great about the 20% and we think it's the biggest new business renewal quarter or the year, and we think the guide is appropriate.
Operator
Our next question is from the line of Kash Rangan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Kash Rangan
Hi. Guys congratulations on a terrific quarter. One question for Benioff, one for Hawkins. First for you, Marc Benioff. As the company becomes larger and larger, you've seen historically intact core businesses at larger companies get more and more emphasis, in your case you've got three products that are multi-billion dollar products that you've nurtured organically. So, when you look at the opportunities, emerging opportunities in business intelligence/analytics and the even products like Quip how do you see or make sure that these are nurtured and achieve their full potential which I personally believe that Quip is an exciting product and we saw it at Dreamforce. How can these products be nurtured to be potentially multi-billion dollars businesses in the future? And one for Hawkins, when I do a calculation, rough calculation of your margins, if you reported margins like a perpetual license software company that is taking your bookings and billings, I get about 40 plus percent operating margin adjusted for the fact that you , if you had been doing this is like a perpetual license company. Help us reconcile margin performance as it is, it's extremely strong. So $20 billion in revenue which is your long term target what could your reported operating margins look like? Thanks that's it from me.
Marc Benioff
Okay. Well, thank you for that Kash. It's something that, I think about all the time which is that we have a rich portfolio of products. And it is constantly getting enhanced and extended and also integrated as we build out our vision of a single CRM platform and certainly collaboration is a part of that with Quip and you can see the incredible capabilities and I know that you were especially impressive that at Dreamforce and its had huge impact on so many businesses that we have spoken about and talked about including our own. And Salesforce is a very rich product line in marketing and commerce and service and communities and sales and collaboration like you mentioned in industries and across all these kind of core capabilities we have that we mentioned some of those on the call already like Trailhead and Einstein in Lightning, and IOT in Roku and Analytics in App Exchanging.
And there is more to talk about that as well, I mean we could go on and I think that the way we look at that at Salesforce is that we are managing that full portfolio and moving that full portfolio to our customers and showing them as they are ready to accept each one of those components how it can extend and compliment and make their connection with their customers so much richer. There is no doubt that the core that we're in which is customer is enhanced by each of those capabilities. And each customer is ready to accept those capabilities that are slightly different timeframe. But this is really given us the ability with our direct sales organization to listen deeply to the customer to understand where they are in their evolution in their capabilities and what they are ready to and if they are not ready to go into sales we'll show them service if they are not ready to do service we'll go to commerce, if they are not ready to go to commerce, we're going to go to collaboration.
So, we have a full set of cards that we can play and go forward and Keith would you, you want to just touch on that as well and talk about what it's like to sell the full cocktail.
Keith Block
I think we're all ready for cocktails. But you know look, the customers are also maybe looking for solutions, so from a internal to external perspective, as we managed the business and as we managed the portfolio, we are big believers in specialization. We organize around specialization whether its industry or product lines so that we can make sure that bring the best experience in the most rich content we possibly can to the customer.
And from a customer perspective when you think about their buying patterns, they want to buy a solution in fact every customer is buying technology because they have a business problem to solve. So our job is to paint a vision for the future in a relative industry, relative size customer and a geography and paint that solution mapping our technology capabilities bringing the entire portfolio to bear to solve that business problem and that's what we see every single day.
Mark Hawkins
Okay, Kash. Let me take the third part of the question here; you had kind of a multi-dimension of that. But the first thing is in terms of your assessment of kind of union economics, I exactly see the analysis that you are doing, but I think we've long affirmed in union economic basis that mid 30s operating margin long term is certainly viable. The, and that's what we're experiencing. Secondly, in terms of Q3 I agree with your assessment, very strong operating margin expand in 360 basis points, good scaling both in sales and marketing MGNA as planned. And as planned for the year which keeps us intact for our whole plan for delivering the operating margin percent improvement for the year on higher revenue base of course.
And I think that also sets us up for finish in the fourth year in a row of expanding our operating margin consistent with the way we said we would and as I mentioned as you touch on to the forward looking periods for 2019 on the call in February I'll also communicate the fifth year in a row of operating margin expansion. At the same time, while we've been doing, this durable growth and driving this incredible opportunity going forward.
As you touched on the last point which FY 2022 like what to expect, I think the thing that I would say to you is again we'll talk about operating margin in 2019, but as I said a Dreamforce if you want to get in the right zip code you should just think about the kind of operating margin improvement we've been delivering while delivering this durable growth in a last couple of years, I think that's a good reference point. We know that will be helpful and we also know that we have an incredible $105 billion tame in a great set up in front of us. So, hope that gives you the context.

Our next question is from the line of Michael Nemeroff with Credit Suisse.
Michael Nemeroff
Hi guys thanks for taking my questions, congrats on a nice Q3. When you are talking to customers about digital transformation of their customer interactions, what percent of the talks nowadays are with customers that want to discuss their overall digital transformation strategy right at the beginning and go to wall-to-wall as Keith described earlier versus customers that are still only seeking a point product sale and how is that trend been going over the last couple of quarters?
Keith Block
So, I'll take this one. The good news is that we have a very, very balanced portfolio. And as we've discussed in the call and Mark and I have seen this over the last 24 months, there is a very accelerated increase in CEO dialogue. So that dialogue is all about digital transformation. And in some cases they have a position on the particular topic, but in many cases they are asking us for our point of view as I said earlier. And for us to paint a vision about what their digital transformation that is becoming a more, I would say more frequent dialogue, now mark alluded this earlier, the appetite to digest a full wall-to-wall digital transformation from the first interaction with the CEO is actually very, very rare. Typically it is, we love the vision, we understand what the future brings whether its B2C platform or B2B platform, what Artificial Intelligence and Einstein can bring, but let's start off incrementally and prove the value and then we can go wall-to-wall.
But the level of dialogue is up leveled significantly with respect to what levels in the organizations we are talking to and what our capabilities are. I mean just last week I was in Europe and met with over 50 CEOs and the topic was all about digital transformation and how these companies move. So it's becoming more and more frequent.

Our next question is from Terry Tillman with SunTrust Robinson.
Terry Tillman
Yes thanks and my congratulations on the quarter. My question is for Keith, thanks for the data point earlier in terms of more than half of new businesses coming from partners and that's up dramatically. Is that an area of leverage you can actually get in yourselves of marketing going forward and maybe you could just give us an update on how productivity is with enterprise Salesforce?
Keith Block
Yes. So as you know our whole ecosystem focus on partners as one of three growth levers along with industry specialization and the international expansion. And when you think about specifically the SIs and again in my trip to Europe last week I was with the CEOs of two of the five global firms. They have incredible reach. They are in the boardroom. They are able to paint a vision alongside with us many times we go into the boardroom or with the sea levels we together. Just as important is our ability to drive the success of the customer and that's where we need these very close relationships with the SIs.
So, it is a huge leverage point from us in terms of our ability to drive these transformations from both the selling and delivery perspective. And those relationships to the SIs are very, very healthy. Again, we enjoy 360 degree view, excuse me, relationship with these SIs, the top five all run their business on Salesforce. Their fastest growing practices or all the Salesforce practice which is great news. And some of them as you know are actually transforming their own business and becoming ISVs and building product like Accenture has done traditionally and others have talked to us about as well.
So, it is a huge leverage point. It drives customer success which is what we are all about and it is a huge part of our strategy and it's being off, you can see it in the results.

Our next question is from the line of Adam Holt with MoffettNathanson.
Adam Holt
Hi. It's Adam Holt from MoffettNathanson. I had two questions about the very strong revenue and congrats on that and a terrific Dreamforce. First, Keith, I guess for you, it sounds like you continue to see good new customer adds out of the vertical business. I was wondering if you could talk about the dynamics of those new customers either in terms of how big the deals are from a [C count] [ph] perspective and/or the attach rate to some of the other products.
And then, I guess my second question would be for maybe Marc Benioff. We heard a lot of activity around Lightning; Lightning upgrades, Lightning adoption at Dreamforce. And I wanted to get your sense for what that means to your customer base and any comments about the financial impact of that Lightning migration would be terrific? Thanks guys.
Keith Block
Yes. Okay. So, generally speaking when we sell as a vertical solution or a product let's say as like financial services cloud that is more likely to air on the side of a transformation. So, those have a tendency to be large deals which kind of goes to the second part of your question, which is every time we saw one of these vertical solutions it drags to the other components of our customer successful platform. So, it may drag service cloud, it may drag sales cloud, it may drag analytics, it may drag Einstein. But, there is a more likely chance that when we sell one of these products like financial services cloud, that it will drive a pretty substantial size relationship into the future. So, it drags more of a transformation and it also brings along other products with it.
Marc Benioff
I will just touch briefly on the Lightning and then I will tip it over to Bret. Salesforce has done something I think really incredible which is that we've delivered a massive transformation and how we actually interact with our users. And that is moving from our traditional classic user interface, which we call the Aloha to our amazing new user interface which we call Lightning. And the power of Lightning of course is that it's not just a new user interface, it's an incredible platform. It's an experience. And it's built in an amazing componentized architecture and our customers absolutely love it as you saw Dreamforce, I think every single demonstration that I saw in the show whether it was on the floor or was customers was on Lightning. And I think very few companies have gone through this transformation that we have gone through so successfully. It has impacted our customers very dramatically and it still has a lot more value to unleash for our customers specifically in the application development and deployment area, we have a huge vision for the clarity of developers where these executives who maybe are not traditional computer science professionals can build very, very complex rich customer experiences and deliver those with very high levels of productivity and I think we are going to see that play out this year.
Lightning far exceeded our expectations, we have still a huge amount of work to do to get all of our customers and all of our users up on Lightning but we have made huge progress already and Bret you want to fill-in kind of your vision on where Lightning will go over the next couple of years.
Bret Taylor
Yes. One thing I would add, I mean the one thing to emphasize what Marc said is that power of Lightning it's not just a new interface, it's a decoded platform. And what if we talked about over and over again but it is really important to internalize, is this means that people are experts in their business who are not necessarily experts at computer programming can make meaningful business applications that transform their companies and transform their relationship with their customers. So, it's truly an enabler. And I think that you heard one of the themes is just helping companies with their change management as they transform their businesses from the classic interface to Lightning. And you saw that in our Dreamforce announcements with the continued investments in trailhead. Trailhead is our learning platform and at Dreamforce we want to stay at platform called MyTrailhead that's enabling companies to customize this learning platform to be custom to their businesses.
And this is really -- feeds into our company's strategies to move to this new platform and also feeds into enabling a broader base of their employees to participate as developers in the Salesforce ecosystem, which is a big part of our Lightning strategy.

Our next question is from the line of Abhey Lamba with Mizuho Securities.
Abhey Lamba
Yes. Thank you. And congrats on a good quarter and congrats Bret for the promotion. So continuing on the theme that you are talking about Bret, can you talk about two to three big product initiatives that you think should be at the top of your list as you starting out in your new role?
Bret Taylor
Yes. I would say -- I mean you are going to hear a lot of the same themes because I think they are truly transformational or multiyear. The first is trailhead. We really do think that our differentiate us as a company is the community of people who have been built around it. There is lot of folks who have made mid-career transitions into technology because of the power of Salesforce and the power of trailhead. We do believe it's an honor for more people on our society to benefit from the economic opportunities of technology. And you see that win 170,000 people shop in San Francisco every year there because they have defined their careers on Salesforce and it really represents the opportunity we think we can provide just a really broad base of people beyond just that select few who have benefited from technology in the past.
The second is artificial intelligence, we launched Einstein last year. You saw that was a big part of our Dreamforce announcements this year. We are just at the beginning stages of intelligences impact on all of our businesses and all of our customer businesses. We feel an obligation to help our customers navigate this, help employees navigate the changes to their jobs and we know that as we sort of build not just products but platforms help companies apply this very complex technologies in very simple ways that's always been our vision there.
And final area of focus is our platform. Business has used our products because they are customizable and extensible. It applies to our industry solutions that Keith was talking about. This is really the future for our growth is enabling people not to have a one size fits all versions of Salesforce but truly customize and extend and benefit from this ecosystem around Salesforce. Those are my areas of focus.

Our next question is from the line of Walter Pritchard with Citi.
Walter Pritchard
Hi. Thanks. I think question for Marc Benioff. Just curious on the [indiscernible] expansion with cloud successful adoption of Amazon in Australia, in Canada. I'm wondering how you are thinking about potentially more aggressively expanding in the new countries. I know that maybe just part of the calculus there. But curious, if we should expect more aggressive outside of the fairly limited countries that you have done over the last decade or more?
Marc Benioff
Well, thanks for that question. I think you saw a Dreamforce, we dramatically expanded our relationship and alliances across the level. You mentioned Amazon which is a strategic alliance for Salesforce and we have turned on our Canada and Australia data center. We also have announced a strategic relationship with Google. And the intension there is to be able to turn on additional countries as well. And we also have the strategic relationships with other key providers that are extending our technology infrastructure and capabilities including key companies like IBM and Dell and Cisco.
And when we look at these opportunities to partner with these companies, it gives us tremendous flexibility and how we deploy our infrastructure whether it's natively here or whether it's on one of their platforms. And we have made tremendous gains and the ability to deploy Salesforce in a variety of clouds and capabilities and this of course is completely transparent to our customers.
The most important thing to our customers is that we give them the reliability and availability and security and far most the trust that they expect from us. And then, we can deploy that through a variety of capabilities. So, I think that's still very much an evolving process for our company as many of these companies they have some of the new capabilities now for us to be able to take advantage of and we are able to do that in many, many exciting new ways.
Bret, you have been spending a lot of time studying this, do you want to add to that?
Bret Taylor
No. I think the main point is, we are really excited to partner with all these different vendors so that we can essentially apply the best infrastructure strategy for the region and customer that were deploying in and that kind of flexibility I can consider as strategic advantage. And expanding these partnerships has been a great opportunity to have more flexibilities and move forward.
Walter Pritchard
Great. Thank you.
Operator
Our next question is from the line of Jennifer Lowe with UBS.
Jennifer Lowe
Great. Thank you. Bret, first congrats on the promotion. And I wanted to ask a little bit in the context of both Bret and Alex moving into more senior roles, key level roles in the organization, should we read anything into that in terms of the relative -- I mean obviously you are product centric company and always have been. But, is there any sort of shift in, in how you are thinking about the investment in product or product management and how should we think about their roles relative to what Parker Harris will be doing?
Marc Benioff
This is a great question. So, I think that we continued to make very significant investments in our innovation, I think that's one of the reasons what you saw both Forbes and Fortune say that Salesforce.com is the most innovative company in the world this year and why we have been selected on those most innovative list probably more than any other company in our industry in the last five years. And we continue to make both organic innovation and you've seen us and I think Bret is a great example of this, bring in organic innovation into our company as well even Alex Dayon is an example of that. Both Alex and Bret were CEOs of companies that we acquired.
And I think as Parker and I have run the company together over last 18 years. We continue to have what we call beginners mind when it comes to innovation. That is we are constantly amazed at all the technology and innovation and capability that is coming through our industry and we look at how can we use that technology whether we built it internally or whether it's coming externally to benefit our customers. And that philosophy has really benefited us really dramatically and we tried to stay away from traditional kind of NAH type environment not which is NAH stands for [indiscernible] and kind of be open to new executives and new companies, new technologies coming to Salesforce.
Parker continues to run and is our Chief Technology Risk Officer responsible for all aspects of technology and engineering, that's my co-founder in the company and runs all of our engineering efforts and infrastructure efforts.
Bret is our Chief Product Officer -- President and Chief Product Officer now. And he is responsible for the overall product management and marketing organization. And as well as clarity of all of the products that we are building and responsible for defining those products and delivering those products.
And Alex is now taken on a new responsibility that I feel is extremely important for the company which is why I asked him to take this position, which is our Chief Strategy Officer to help us to map out not to $20 billion because we have short-term clarity to that but really beyond that Salesforce just have so much potential that as we really map out to become I think extremely large company from where we are now. We need to have a executive team completely dedicated to mapping out the future and Alex is going to be absolutely amazing that role and has been done an incredible job since we first acquired his company, I think it's almost been a decade ago.
So, I want to congratulate both Bret and Alex on that and Parker and I cannot be more thrilled with the state of our technology and I don't think that there is a better mirror of that than Dreamforce where Parker and I walk through together to show we are just amazed at the level of customer success.

Our next question is from the line of Derrick Wood with Cowen & Company.
Derrick Wood
Thanks. I wanted to touch on service cloud, you had some leadership changes over the last couple of years. You had some evolving product focus. But, you just reported a nice reacceleration and growth. So, could you update us on the priorities to drive growth and service cloud and maybe what you have done recently to help strengthen that?
And then, a follow-up on Europe, we saw the highest growth in three years you guys clearly are investing a lot in Europe, I'd be curious, how much do you think that the strength that Europe is due to your own investments and how much is due to the macro or greater adoption of cloud in that region? Thanks.
Marc Benioff
Okay. I will take the service cloud question and I will throw it to Keith on Europe, since he was there last week.
I think on Service Cloud, this remains an incredibly exciting opportunity, I expect some of the acceleration in numbers that you saw this quarter to continue for the next couple of quarters. And I would be disappointed if they didn't.
Service cloud has had a huge year for us this year and we have some just amazing things happening with service cloud, you saw that at the show especially in regards to some of the next generation capabilities of customer service including this idea of bots and Einstein bots. That there is not just kind of traditional call center environment not just the traditional customer service portal. But that an incredible new customer channel is emerging with bots.
So, we are going to see that be a huge part I think of Service Cloud. Service Cloud has done a phenomenal job becoming the number one customer to their service solution in the world not only by revenue but also rated by Gartner in their customer engagement magic quadrant. And has grown so fast, you're seeing kind of an acceleration of that management team and growth of that management team. So, as it went from zero to 100 million it had a different management team, in fact that was run by Alex Dayon at that time. It went from 100 million to a billion, it had a different management team as it went from a billion to 2 billion. And now as it goes from 2 billion to 5 billion, I expect it all continued to accelerate and grow and that management team just changed again. And we couldn't be more excited with the team that we brought in to run service cloud and I will turn it over to Keith.
Keith Block
Yes. Just a quick comment on that as well. Listen, the innovation around service cloud has been fantastic, I think the product team has done a wonderful job, if you talk to any company one of the ways that they differentiate themselves is service. And certainly another accelerate on that business has been field service Lightning. KONE was prominently --and the CEO of KONE prominently on display at Dreamforce talking about their own transformation and how they are leveraging field service, in fact, they are co-innovating around that product with us. So that has certainly helped to accelerate our service cloud growth.
With respect to Europe, again, I did my European tour last week hitting five countries. And it was very interesting in talking to the CEOs. I think it's pretty clear that when you look at the macro environment at least the governments, what's going on in the U.K., what's going on in Germany? It's a little bit of uncertainty.
So, our great performance in Europe is just incredible execution. There is clearly a need and a thirst for digital transformation. There is a need and a thirst for customer engagement that's why you have companies like Adidas and KONE and ING and others in all these great industries and into these great brands that want us take step into the move -- move -- future around this digital transformation.
So, it's great execution. It's a thirst for moving into this new era that we are in this new fourth industrial revolution. I don't believe this has anything to do with the lift or any particular headwind one way or the other with the macro environment. We are just executing and taking share.
If you look at the overall market data, again, IDC, market data suggest, that we are growing three times that of the CRM market. So, it's again, I think it speaks volumes about our products, our customers, our partners and our employee execution.

And our last question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead with Deutsche Bank.
Karl Keirstead
Thank you. Two for Mark Hawkins. Mark can you briefly elaborate on the decision to no longer give DR guide, what it is about 606 that makes the DR visibility change to that extent?
And then, secondly, do you mind just touching on the seasonality of cash flow, obviously, the same thing happened last third quarter when cash flow was a bit light, and then, you ended up crushing it in the fourth quarter. Apart from maybe Dreamforce dropping in 3Q this year, anything else changing the cash flow seasonality that you can call out as we think about 4Q free cash? Thank you.
Mark Hawkins
Sure, happy to do so, Karl. Thank you.
First of all, with ASC 606 for the new revenue standard, they would be live on the 1 February. The key thing there is, we will have a roll forward for the bill deferred revenue that's for sure. And then, we are also going to provide some information on the unbilled DR. So, you will have the information that you need, obviously, things are changing and the standard is such that, the new information will be -- what you need effectively. So, I don't know how to explain it better than to say that fundamentally the standard has changed. We are going to give good visibility to the information people need and the world is just fundamentally changed in terms of what is expected including the roll forward balance sheet. That's the first thing I would say.
The second thing, I would say is in terms of seasonality of the operating cash flow, you are absolutely right Karl, you can see it on the compounding and the attachment on the IR slide deck of that continued compounding on the invoice inside and how that impacts obviously cash flow. The thing that I would say to you, that's a little bit special this quarter special context if you will, a) you touched on Dreamforce timing and then, b) you know, we had a very, very strong quarter as evidenced by 31% growth in our total DR both billed and unbilled and there is commissions that come with that strong performance and including those commissions have an impact on our cash in the short-term. But, the thing that I would say to you is the cash flow guidance is in tact for the year. We are going to deliver the guidance that we had promised and there is just a little bit of wiggle due to a couple of this different factors. That's what I would say.
Operator
That's all the questions we have in the queue. I'd like to turn the call back over to Mr. Marc Benioff.
Marc Benioff
Well, thank you very much. And closing for the call, I really want to appreciate all of you who have joined us during Thanksgiving week and taking your time and I wish all of you and your families the very best for this holiday weekend and I hope that you all have a healthy and safe Thanksgiving.
At Salesforce, we've always been a company that believes in doing well and doing good and as you know that's because we are committed to a core set of values, trust, growth, innovation in the quality of very human being. And I will tell you that it sees values and it is reminded at this time of Thanksgiving as much as these incredible technologies that bring so many amazing people partners and as you as well, our investors to Salesforce. You also know that's why 171,000 people registered for Dreamforce this year, the amazing energy that was there incredible experience with so many people. And an additional, almost 11 million people viewed it online with us.
We are aspiring to build a company for the ages and a brand and a culture that will make the world a better place, not simply for another quarter or another year, but for decades to come.
So, with all of that, I want to thank you, again, for attending the call and to have a happy Thanksgiving.
