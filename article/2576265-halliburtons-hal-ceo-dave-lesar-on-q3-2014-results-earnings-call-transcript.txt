Good day, ladies and gentlemen. And welcome to the Halliburtonâs Third Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.
I would now like to introduce your host for todayâs conference, Kelly Youngblood, Halliburtonâs Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.
Kelly Youngblood
Good morning. And welcome to the Halliburton third quarter 2014 conference call. Todayâs call is being webcast and a replay would be available on Halliburton's website for seven days.
Joining me today are Dave Lesar, CEO; Mark McCollum, CFO; and Jeff Miller, President. Some of our comments today may include forward-looking statements reflecting Halliburton's views about future events. These matters involve risk and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to materially differ from our forward-looking statements. These risks are discussed in Halliburtonâs Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013, Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2014, recent current reports on Form 8-K and other Securities and Exchange Commission filings. We undertake no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statements for any reason.
Our comments today include non-GAAP financial measures, reconciliations to the most direct comparable GAAP financial measures are included in our third quarter press release which can be found on our website.
Unless otherwise noted, in our discussion today, we will be excluding the impact of restructuring charges taken in the third quarter of 2013 and an insurance recovery and a decrease to our reserve taken during the third quarter of 2014, both of which are related to the Macondo litigation.
Now Iâll turn the call over to Dave. Dave.
Dave Lesar
Thank you Kelly and good morning to everyone. I can tell you I am really pleased with our third quarter results. Even with all the noise out there this quarter and things such as Russian sanctions, disruptions in Libya and Iraq, the supply chain challenges we faced, and customer delays in the Gulf of Mexico, I believe we met these challenges head on, fought through them and weâre successful, and I am really proud of our employees who made it happen.
Now here are the headlines: record company revenue of $8.7 billion. We also delivered industry leading revenue and operating income growth, both sequentially and year-over-year, once again outgrowing our peer group.
New quarterly revenue records for both North America and the Eastern hemisphere with double-digit sequential revenue growing in Latin America, and one I know you are going to want to hear is that the exit rate for this quarter for North American margins was over the 20% margin mark, a major milestone in delivering our analyst day commitment to you, our shareholders.
In addition, our job board in North America remained sold out and we are delivering new stimulation equipment that will allow us to add incremental work in the fourth quarter with no negative impact on our margins.
We believe the Macondo case is an essentially over for Halliburton, based on our settlement in the judgeâs ruling in the litigation. And lastly, we continue to focus on delivering higher shareholder returns to you. This quarter, we repurchased an additional $300 million in stock, and our Board of Directors has approved an additional 20% dividend increase, meaning we now have doubled our quarterly dividend over the past two years.
Now letâs go through some of the geographies. Company operating income increased 21% sequentially. North America grew 15%, Europe, Africa/CIS 16%, and Latin America more than doubled by growing 126% from the prior quarter.
In North America, activity levels continued to surge higher month over month due to an unprecedented level of service intensity. As you will recall, I called the turn two quarters ago. This quarter, things are clearly accelerating out of that turn, and we do not see momentum slowing anytime soon.
We also made excellent progress on pricing and our stimulation contract renewals and on cost recovery for ongoing contracts. Across key basins, we have negotiated higher prices that at a minimum should recover current and expected future cost inflation, and we should begin to see the full impact of new contract pricing as we move in to 2015.
Now a hot topic today is obviously proppant and sand logistics, and we did experience some disruptions early in the third quarter where work was delayed because we were waiting on sand deliveries, and we did in fact miss some jobs as did nearly every other service company.
But I can tell you, we have great people who helped us manage through this challenge each and every day, and we have now taken actions to get ahead of this issue going forward, and Jeff will provide details on this in a few minutes.
Now moving to our international markets, despite the geopolitical issues we faced in areas like Russia, Libya, and Iraq, our eastern hemisphere activity continues to expand at a steady rate. On the strength of markets like Saudi Arabia, Southern Iraq, West Africa, and the Caspian, we are on track to deliver double-digit revenue growth for the full year 2014. In addition, we expect to be awarded $1 billion of new work in Iraq.
And consistent with previous years, we expect the fourth quarter in the eastern hemisphere to be our strongest quarter of the year due to seasonal year-end software and equipment sales.
So, over the last three years, weâve delivered industry-leading, double-digit revenue growth in the eastern hemisphere, and as we look ahead to 2015, we anticipate the rate of growth may slightly moderate due to headwinds from ongoing geopolitical issues as well as customer spending adjustments, especially among the IOCs as they seek to achieve better returns for their company.
And although double-digit growth may be a challenge for any service company next year, we fully expect to continue to outpace our peers in revenue growth whatever market is handed to us.
Now letâs move to Latin American. This has been an area thatâs had a tough year. Even with better revenue in the third quarter, margins and overall activity levels still do not meet my expectations, due primarily to continued operational delays in Mexico. But as we look ahead, I see several positive factors finally coming in to play.
First, we are up and running on our integrated projects in Mexico and expect to be at full operational capacity in early 2015. We are also excited about the pace of Mexico energy reform and expect to see strong opportunities in Mexico shale, mature fields, and deepwater markets in the coming years.
In Brazil, negotiations on the recently retendered directional-drilling contract are progressing, and we expect to be operating under the new and more profitable contract as we transition into the first quarter. And last but not least, we are very excited about our recent multi-billion dollar award in Ecuador where we expect strong growth as these projects ramp up next year. So for Latin America, I expect a much strong 2015 and we are well positioned for tremendous growth potential in the coming years.
Now before I close, I have to recognize that there is currently a concern about the recent decline in commodity prices. I am not going to predict what the oil price is going to be, but on a longer term, we believe industry fundamentals suggest that these lower prices are not sustainable.
While we might be in a slight oversupply situation right now, remember demand is still growing. Therefore considering North America and OPEC production expectations, the continued tightness in global spare production capacity and potential geopolitical impacts on non-OPEC production, we believe that supply and demand will essentially be back in balance in a relatively short period of time.
Nevertheless, we are keenly aware that there is a risk of a moderation in activity if oil prices remain weak for an extended period of time. What I can tell you is that in recent conversations with our North America customers, we have not received any indication of activity levels slowing as we transition into 2015.
For example, last week the IEA commented that approximately 98% of North America liquids projects have a breakeven price below $80 per barrel and over 80% work below $60 a barrel. On the international front, the majority of our NOC customers have not indicated that their activity levels will slow down at all.
However, as I mentioned before, we are ready expecting our IOC customers to moderate their capital budgets in 2015 to improve their individual company returns. That being said, we canât be in denial about what is happening in the market today. As you know, I have been around the block a few times and I can tell you our management team is well equipped to handle this kind of uncertainty.
We will control what we can control in areas such as cost management, contract price renewals and managing customer relationships. We know that we can do these things very well. My experiences taught me that if we keep the franchise strong and growing, and I can tell you that we are going to do that, aligned with the right customers which weâve already done and take care of our employees, we will be fine in the long run.
Whether this uncertainty lasts for a few months or longer, we are ready for any market. I think we are well positioned as a company to capture all of the market upside potential for you, while giving you protection to any downside.
Strategically we are structured to deliver the lowest cost per barrel to our customers, which in turn positions them and Halliburton to perform best in volatile markets. As such we believe oil prices will have to remain at lower levels for a sustained period before the long term economics would begin to impact our primary customers.
So to sum it up, our overall strategy is working well and we intend to stay the course. Whatever the market, we believe we can outperform our peers, and we remained focused on consistent execution, generating superior financial performance and providing industry leading shareholder returns. We have delivered this to you in the past and I believe we will continue to do so in the future.
Now let me turn the call over to Mark to provide you some financial details. Mark.
Mark McCollum
Thanks Dave and good morning. Let me begin with an overview of our third quarter results, starting with North America. Revenues were up 9% sequentially. This strong all organic growth was relative to a 3% increase in the US land rig count. Operating income was up 15% over the same period, margins for the quarter averaged 19.2% with our September exit rate coming in slightly higher than the 20% mark.
Stronger activity levels in US land and the rebound from the Canadian spring breakup drove the improvement for the quarter, more than offsetting increased logistics cost and the impact of loop currents in the Gulf of Mexico.
Margins also benefited from modest pricing improvements on pressure pumping contract renewals, which were designed to cover inflation on specific cost categories such as transportation, fuel and labor.
In the Eastern Hemisphere, revenue and operating income increased sequentially by 4% and 6% respectively. Growth was led by Europe Africa/CIS where revenue and operating income increased 6% and 16% respectively compared to the prior quarter.
Seasonal increases in Russia and the Caspian, higher activity in Angola, along with increased well, construction activity in continental Europe, led the sequential improvement. Partially offsetting these increases were activity declines in Libya, Algeria and Norway.
The seasonal recovery in Russia was negatively affected by the recent sanctions and growth in this market is expected to be a challenge for the foreseeable future, since weâll be prohibited from tendering projects that fall under the sanctioned restrictions.
We expect our Russia business will continue to face headwinds next year, including the possibility of additional sanctions, but we are hopeful that full-year 2015 could come in at similar levels to this year.
Middle East /Asia region revenue increased by 3% sequentially and operating income was in line with the second quarter. Activity improvements in Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Oman, India and Indonesia during the quarter were mostly offset by sequential declines in stimulation work in Malaysia and Australia.
On a year -over-year basis, weâve seen tremendous revenue growth across Middle East/Asia, Saudi is leading with a 60% improvement and India, Iraq, and Thailand have all delivered growth over 30%.
The conflict in Iraq resulted in a shutdown of the majority of activities in Kurdistan in northern Iraq. However, the majority of our operations had been in southern Iraq away from the fighting where activity levels have remained relatively stable. At this point activity is gradually returning to Kurdistan and overall we expect Iran to be a growth market for us in 2015.
In Latin America revenue increased 16% sequentially, while operating income more than doubled compared to the previous quarter. Mexico was the primary driver where we saw benefit of higher activity on our Humapa project and recent contract approvals, which resulted in an increase in consulting and software revenue for the quarter.
We also experienced higher testing and directional drilling activity in Brazil, as well as increased work over and stimulation activity in Venezuela. Our corporate and other expense totaled $83 million for the quarter a little lower than anticipated, driven by a reduction in strategic initiative cost and lower legal expenses. We anticipate that our corporate expenses for the fourth quarter will be approximately $90 million.
Our effective tax rate for the third quarter was approximately 25%, primarily driven by an adjustment to reflect the recoverability of our net operating loss carry forwards in Brazil. For the fourth quarter you are expecting the effective tax rate to return to our normalized rate of approximately 28 % to 29%.
We now expect our 2014 capital expenditures will be approximately $3.2 billion and depreciation and amortization to be approximately $2.1 billion for the year. During the third quarter we recorded income of $66 million in discontinued operations. This is primarily related to settlement with KBR for amount sold to us under our tax sharing agreement with them.
We announced today that a Board of Directors approved a 20% increase to our quarterly dividend from $0.15-$0.18 per share, resulting in a cumulative 100% increase to our quarterly dividend over the last two years. As previously stated, our intention going forward is for our dividend payout to equal at least 15% to 20% of our net income.
Additionally, based on our continued confidence in our business prospects, we bought back an additional $300 million in shares during the third quarter. We still have $5.7 billion remaining in repurchase authorization from a Board of Directors available for future stock buybacks.
Now moving to the Eastern Hemisphere outlook; in the fourth quarter, we are anticipating moderate growth resulting in a mid-single digit percentage sequential improvement in revenue, with margins in the upper teens.
Middle East/Asia is expected to have a high single digit sequential improvement, with margins approaching 20% for the quarter. We expect our Europe, Africa/CIS region to be relatively flat as a result of geopolitical challenges in Russia and Libya and reduced customer spending in the Norwegian sector of the North Sea.
In Latin America, we expect mid-single digit sequential revenue growth in the fourth quarter, with margins improving modestly from the third quarter. This improvement is expected to result from year-end software and product sales as well as the continued ramp up of our IPM and asset management projects in Mexico.
Concluding with North America; in the fourth quarter, we typically see a seasonal decline in both revenue and margins. This year, however, based on the exit rates, we saw in the third quarter, as well as the incremental equipment, we are currently deployed and considering our forecast for minimal holiday downtime this year, we believe fourth quarter revenue and margins will be flat to modestly higher than the third quarter.
Now, Iâll turn the call over to Jeff for an update on our strategy. Jeff?
Jeff Miller
Thank you. Mark and good morning everyone. Iâm excited about our results this quarter, the Halliburton team is dead focused on strategy execution, and the results are clearly evident in the quarterâs industry-leading growth, with both of our divisions setting revenue records as well as revenue records for 11 of 13 product lines.
As a reminder, our strategy is built around three key growth markets unconventionals, deepwater and mature fields. Our unconventional strategy is designed to deliver the lowest cost per barrel of oil equivalent for our customers with surface efficiency, custom chemistry and subsurface insight.
Our deepwater strategy is to increase reliability and reduce uncertainty. And finally our mature fieldâs strategy is to deliver additional hydrocarbons in declining fields by identifying new reserves and optimizing the recovery of existing reserves.
Clearly these strategies are working. In North America unconventional market the topic on everyoneâs mind this quarter was logistics, driven by big increases in both horizontal activity and completions intensity which is right in the sweet spot of surface efficiencies.
Now compared to the prior year, US horizontal recount in the third quarter was up more than 20%. Over the same timeframe our stage count was up more than 30% and our average sand per well increased by more than 50%.
While the rising recount was predominantly a Permian basin phenomena, our customers are experimenting with larger completion volumes in almost every basin. This is a fundamental change in well design that we believe is part of a continuing trend.
As Dave said, earlier in the quarter, we experienced issues related to logistical disruptions, primarily around proppant. Cast in terms of surface efficiency increasing intensity presents a terrific opportunity for us. Weâve addressed these rising completion volumes by expanding our infrastructure and transport capability.
This includes increasing our sand terminal capacity by over 100%, and we are on a path to double our current rate fleet. In terms of the last mile, trucking from the railhead out to the location weâve added over 30 new contract suppliers so far this year, giving us a better footprint in the capacity to handle these intense volumes of work.
Additionally, we implemented a sand logistics command centre in Houston, where operation personnel monitor supply levels in the basins and the set with transport and procurement specialists for tracking our rail and trucking fleets all in real time. The combination of these steps resulted in a sharp increase in efficiency and we are confident that this integrated approach to logistics will continue to differentiate Halliburton.
A quick update on our CYPHER seismic-to-stimulation platform; we are now at over 60 projects running, with more in the pipeline. In addition to taking on new work, we are also seeing customers expand CYPHER engagements to multiple basins in North America.
Most recently we started a multi-year CYPHER project in the Permian basis incorporating the full breadth of our products and services. We are only a few months in to the study, but early wells have already seen more than a 20% increase in average production compared to offset wells.
And CYPHER continues to serve as an engine for commercializing new technology like RockPerm a proprietary chemistry service that enables better oil flow and then FRACINSIGHT a Halliburton software package to help customers optimize the perforation placement and deliver the most efficient wells.
We are very pleased with the client uptake on the CYPHER platform and typically see follow-on work in additional basins with those same clients. Our execution of surface efficiency, custom chemistry and subsurface insight led to more than 20% extra rate margins for North America in the third quarter.
In deepwater we remain focused on technology that reduces uncertainty and improves reliability for our customers. I will give you a couple of examples of technology that are getting traction right now. The GeoTap IDS which is a sampling-while-drilling tool allows clients to take multiple fluid samples which reduces uncertainty while at the same time reducing costly rig time.
Another is BaraECD which is a drilling fluid that allows customers to stabilize circulating density enabling them to reliably drill more complex wells. We have already seen success on a global basis from the Gulf of Mexico to the North Sea to the offshore Asia, and most recently in deepwater Angola.
But the real point here is that we are executing a technology strategy that does exactly what we say to help clients reduce uncertainty and increase reliability in deepwater. And now finally in mature fields, our customers continue to look for ways to enhance recovery rates, whether through discreet product offerings such as a recently acquired Progressive Cavity Pump technology or through large scale asset management projects.
Let me highlight just a couple of these large project opportunities. The first is the recently awarded IGAPO project in Ecuador. This is a project that provides asset management across nine mature fields.
This is a 15 year project that we expect to provide a stable, long term revenue stream that could potentially double our business in the country, representing a multi-billion dollar opportunity over the full term of the project. We are very excited about this opportunity in Ecuador and expect work to begin late in the first quarter of 2015.
Second, we recently extended and integrated drilling project in southern Iraq and are encourage by progress on several other significant IPM projects in the country. We believe these opportunities will provide a platform for continued double-digit growth in the Middle East region throughout 2015.
Now beyond these recent awards, we are currently evaluating a pipeline of well over $30 billion worth of IPM work, which gives us confidence that we are on the right track with our mature field strategy.
And in closing we believe that our strategies continue to provide growth opportunities. Our technology, infrastructure and processes are aligned and we are relentlessly focused on superior growth margins and returns.
Now I will turn the call back over to Dave for his closing comments. Dave?
Dave Lesar
Alright, thank you Jeff. Before we go to the questions let me summarize what you heard today. North American exit margins greater than 20%, our new equipment will be going to work at at least those exit margins.
We are building our North American logistics to get ahead of the curve. We made good progress this quarter negotiating price increases with our customers and in Latin America headwinds are becoming tailwinds, and 2015 is shaping up to be a much stronger year.
In the Eastern Hemisphere there are few troubled spots, but we still an opportunity for steady growth in the coming year and we continue to focus on delivering the highest shareholder returns as evidenced by our 20% dividend increase in addition of $300 million of stock repurchases during the quarter.
Before I close I want to make one final comment on the current environment. The strategic initiatives weâve been working on the last several years Battle Red, Frac of the Future and others make us what I believe is the most efficient and adaptable organization in the industry.
We are able to execute equally well in either a boom market or one thatâs more challenged. Across the board, we are focused on making better wells for our customers and better returns for you our shareholders. So no matter what market is handed to us, our strategies give us confidence that we will continue to outperform our peers.
So with that letâs open it up for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
(Operator Instructions) our first question comes from James West of ISI. Your line is now open.
James West - ISI
First of all, just congrats on the substantial year-over-year growth in Eastern Hemisphere well above your peers. I suspect Joe Rainey is pretty proud of what heâs been able accomplish. And then Dave as you mentioned, youâve been around the block a couple of times here, and I wanted to know kind of whatâs your gut telling you right now about the outlook for North America as we go into next year?
I know itâs a tough question, but itâs on everybodyâs mind, and given your history in the industry, I was curious about kind of your feel for what you think is going to happen next year.
Dave Lesar
Let me let Jeff take the first crack at it and then I will come in at the end if I feel I need to add something.
Jeff Miller
Our outlook today is very positive. We are in the heavy part of our renewal period now, and I would tell you that renewals are rolling up not down, and as of last week, I talked to a lot of customers and budgets are moving up, not down. So in terms of activity, everything I see looks like its increasing into 2015 and quite frankly our strategy that we have in place around delivering the lowest cost per BOE in the market is more valuable than ever.
Dave Lesar
So I guess let me just add, I think if you want to summarize it, we are not feeling, hearing, seeing anything that says this momentum is going to change that we had coming out of Q3.
James West - ISI
And then on the international side, I think you gave a good outline of most of the regions around the world, you know some obviously slowness from the IOCs, but the same type of commentary around the NOCs in the international markets, no commentary around them slowing down.
Jeff Miller
Not seen any of that James. This is Jeff, the capital is going to work, itâs going to work in mature fields, itâs going to work in unconventionals, maybe more so than deepwater, but again where we are positioned and what we are seeing around integrated asset management opportunities as in just a traditional work, nothing leads us to believe that from an IOC perspective there is any change - NOC perspective.
Operator
Our next question comes from Jud Bailey of Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.
Jud Bailey - Wells Fargo
Question on the fourth quarter, you had indicated North American margins are -- you exited at 20%. I believe Mark indicated you thought only a slight increase in margins from 3Q to 4Q. Is that just allowing for seasonality or how should we think about the fourth quarter âa seasonally fourth quarter where your exit rate was above kind of what you had indicated, I guess?
Mark McCollum
Hey Jud this is Mark. Yeah, thatâs exactly right, you know we always try to consider that fourth quarter you have some holiday down time, you are going to have some seasonality particularly in the Rockies where we have a dominant market position that will impact operations as you close out the year. But what we are doing is we are looking at every thing on balance; first of all very strong exit rates, second of all very strong activity levels that month-over-month continues to increase.
When we are working, our equipment is working very hard. We had already indicated earlier in the year that weâve been building additional frac equipment, you know weâll have new spreads that are already hitting the street today that will be active during the fourth quarter, that will be adding to our complement of equipment that will be generating revenues, and so when you take all that on balance, we are just saying that this fourth quarter uniquely looks like one that we could have a slightly better earnings and profits in this fourth quarter in North America than you might see in a traditional fourth quarter.
Now thatâs assuming a very sort of standard weather pattern, standard holiday downtime. But from our base outlook, it looks like its going to be a very good Q4.
Jud Bailey - Wells Fargo
And then if I could may be stretch the margin outlook into 2015, understanding that customers arenât really indicating a slowdown at this point, if we were to see some operators sort of scale back activity or just flatten out their budgets, can you help us think about -- Halliburtonâs going to have a lot of moving parts, you are negotiating new contract at higher pricing, it sounds like now.
If you see a softness in utilization and you are obviously recovering some of your recent cost increases as well; how should we think about your margins in 2015 if we were to see a slow down. Is it a situation where you think you could hold the line of margins, would they decline potentially or could they still go up because of the net pricing you are already starting to see in your contracts?
Jeff Miller
Yeah Jud this is Jeff. Our entire strategy is built around delivering Frac of the Future or HALvantage. If we roll back to our analyst day, weâd always said that we would continue to put more efficient equipment in the market and more efficient work practices so that we would be able to improve margins on the back of the way that we are working.
So as I look out into 2015, we are seeing those fundamental pieces of our business continuing to deliver which clearly means that we continue to see a positive impact on margins.
Dave Lesar
Yeah I think, let me just one thing, if you go again, go back to analyst day, the impact of things like Battle Red, Frac of the Future and other things that you were doing at that point, we thought could add five points in margin without any price increases. And we are not backing off that view.
A lot of the push up and margins right now are just those things been implemented and us been more efficient as an organization. So I think to answer the question specifically, if you did have a flattening out, I would expect that our margins would be at least where they are today.
Operator
Our next question comes from Angie Sedita of UBS. Your line is now open.
Angie Sedita - UBS
So there was intensity growth of 50% quarter-over-quarter or year-over-year was pretty amazing, and I know Jeff touched on it a little bit. But could you give us additional color there on what you are seeing on the oil service intensity side and I know you indicated it was [basin], but can you go in to that a little bit. And then thoughts on 2015, what kind of any insights at this point on the degree of service intensity growth that we could see this year and clearly its worth noting that even if the rig count is flat and the well count is flat you are still driving higher revenues in margins.
Jeff Miller
The (inaudible) intensity continue to increase on the basis of the types of jobs that are being designed and so weâve seen a consistent increase in the amount of proppant and the amount of stages. So I refer specifically to 30% increase in stage count, 50% increase in sand consumption.
I would say that you see a bigger ramp in the more mature basins, because thatâs where we are really getting in to what Iâd call sort of hyper efficiency and increasing the production of existing wells as oppose to way before itsâ a little bit more, I will use it with quotes around it âexploratoryâ in a few basins.
But as I look in to 2015, I donâ see anything that changes the pace of increase necessarily across the piece simply because we are making better wells, and thatâs what takes us back to the importance sand logistics and the ability to deliver.
I will give you a one quick anecdote; for us that have seen trains load, we can unload an entire unit train in nine hours and we can load a truck in seven minutes. So thatâs kind of where we are focusing our attention.
Angie Sedita - UBS
Okay, thatâs helpful. And then thinking about this oil service intensity growth and itâs reported out there, we are going to add 1.5 million to 2 million in horsepower next year. How much do you think of that is being added with standalone crews and they are actually full (inaudible) fleets and how much of that horsepower do you think is reinforcement for existing fleets; that there is much of the third or even more.
Jeff Miller
No, I mean when we look at that our expectation thatâs probably less than 10% coming in to the market, and the fact is the equipment is working harder than it has ever worked before given the size of the stages and the amount of the sand. So my expectation is most of that equipment will either be backup equipment, four big jobs now with our Q-10 pumps we are more effective with typically 20% less horsepower on location, and quite frankly less back up. I put very little backup equipment to work in the market.
So thatâs kind of the takeaway is not that concerned, really not concerned about additional horsepower.
Operator
Our next question comes from Ole Slorer of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.
Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley
Sorry to [harpoon] on the sand this year, but some pretty staggering number of 50% up high and kind of what we have heard from other players. Do you think thatâs something that deals with Halliburtonâs customer base and the opposition in the market or do you think this is sort of an industry trend.
Jeff Miller
Well I think itâs a little bit of both Ole, we are working with fairway players, weâve always said that we make it a point to work with the most efficient operators in the market place so that we get the maximum utilization of the technology we are putting in the markets. So we are pumping more sand may be then competitors would not surprise me at all.
But I do think longer term there will be a continued move towards better frac design thinking about our CYPHER technology how we design the best fracs to get the most production out of the wells. And I do believe that will lead us to a continuation of larger volumes.
Ole Slorer - Morgan Stanley
So how are you scaling your infrastructure over the next say two years, and what are you planning for as far as your experience for 2015-â16 volume growth per well.
Jeff Miller
Well let me think about it this way and in terms of what we are doing to address that. I think the volumes will continue to increase across the piece that may not stay at the same rate of increase. But from our standpoint, weâll continue to invest in logistics and control the supply chain really from mine to the last well, from the mine to the last mile it gets us to two locations which looks like sand transloading and investment in rail cars. And these are things that overcome the logistics problems that seem to occur.
Mark McCollum
Which we are certainly â Ole this is Mark just to add to that, from a contracting standpoint, we are working very hard to make sure that weâve got all the sand dates that we are forecasting under contract. You know weâll probably have 80% of our sand needs contracted this year it may go up to 90% next year.
By contracting our sand, looking forward that allows us to shave off anywhere from 15% to 20% off of a spot of sand pricing. Doing the same on rail cars making sure that weâve got plenty of capacity to run full unit trains, making sure that our transloading facilities each one are designed to offload complete unit trains.
We are the only one so far I think to have managed to be able to really offload complete unit trains on sight on some of our location, and we are just going to look forward to where our customers are saying they are going to be running these volumes and make sure that the infrastructures onsite to be able to run as lean and efficient as we possibly can.
Operator
Our next question comes from Bill Herbert of Simmons. Your line is now open.
Bill Herbert â Simmons
Dave and Jeff to tackle the international question just a little bit differently. You guys have been consistent and youâve been correct here with regard to just the pace of international expansion in general over the past several years, and when I look at your numbers for 2014 and juxtapose them against the preceding couple of years, you will likely end up somewhere kind of high-single digits year-over-year in â14 versus kind of a low teens rate of expansion in â13 and a 20% rate of expansion in â12.
So when we contemplate 2015 against the slate of opportunities and threats, at this juncture do you think you will do well to match your international rate of growth of this year or should we expect something less.
Jeff Miller
So the answer to that was, we expect outgrow the market or outgrow our competitors in that space. There clearly are some headwinds when we look around the world right now. So the North Sea, Russia and Libya are clearly going to present headwinds, so quite encouraged around tailwinds in the Middle East and Asia Pacific.
So when I think about growth, more specifically, it may be more of where capital gets put to work, may be than it has been in the past we talked a lot about deepwater, potential moderation as IOCs look at their capital budgets.
But that said, the barrels come from somewhere and our expectation is that we may see more of that capital going in to development and mature field type of opportunities, and so for that reason I am still very encouraged about our ability to sustain growth in to 2015 that would be sort of similar to where we are now.
Bill Herbert - Simmons
Okay, and the billion dollar project in Iraq, can you elaborate on that and also I guess to play devilsâ advocate for a second, why would we even want that given the travails that the industry has witnessed over the past several years there.
Dave Lesar
Let me answer that (inaudible) your first question was your [output] in reverse order. Why would we want that work? The fact is we are a lot smarter in that market than weâve ever been. I think we were early in to that market and underestimated the risk around logistics and a few other things.
We really like the contract the way this one looks in terms of terms and conditions. So feel good about that. The project itself I wonât name the project, but itâs a great project, its four rigs to drill, 120 wells over the next probably three years.
We have invested heavily in putting our IPM team together and they are really executing it. So if I think how we execute on mature fields longer term, these are the kind of projects that we are going to do.

Our next question comes from Brad Handler of Jefferies. Your line is now open.
Brad Handler - Jefferies
May be just a quick one, your CapEx commentary I guess just a little bit lighter than second quarter commentary. What are you reflecting in that, is that a difficulty in spending some capital, and you will spend it in â15 or are you actually shaving it relative to some of the commentary youâve given us this morning.
Jeff Miller
Thereâs not been any kind of a conservative effort to shave capital. I think its probably a little bit tighter forecast particularly as we look forward in some of the projects in the eastern hemisphere. It just takes some time off and times to get things approved and so itâs just timing. So you will see some of that coming in to probably the early part of 2015.
Brad Handler - Jefferies
And then maybe an unrelated to follow-up and may be itâs a bit broader. If I look at your North America D&E revenues, over the nine months itâs sort of tracking the rig count, but I think itâs up 6% again nine months versus nine months and thatâs relative to your horizontal rig count up 13% of US land any way or in the US.
So I know thereâ some other factors and may be you will fill that in to the answer. But how does â what the prognosis for how that is moving forward, are there some things that that might move in place that can accelerate D&E and they can align better with the horizontal rig count. Are there some factors that continue to suggest it will somewhat less than that?
Jeff Miller
Yeah, and I think what you are seeing the current quarter is a bit of impact of the Gulf of Mexico. So we experienced loop currents like everybody else, and so we had a quite a bit slower activity in the Gulf of Mexico in the current quarter. But the well construction type activity is going to track generally speaking the rig count. But we are really encouraged as we look Q4 and beyond hit the loop currents behind us. We really like our share in the Gulf of Mexico right now, and itâs a growing share in the Gulf of Mexico.

Our next question comes from Jim Wicklund of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.
Jim Wicklund - Credit Suisse
Eastern hemisphere production really hasnât grown much in the last couple of years, and you guys are setting records in terms of operating income and revenues, and the US of course has been growing. Is the level of activity in the eastern hemisphere somewhat inelastic considering that we at least have to maintain production.
Jeff Miller
Yes Jim, thatâs the right answer. We are working harder and harder to produce arguably the same number of barrels, but those barrels are critical to number of economies around the world, and so when we look at sort of outlook; two things, one, the projects that are started have to continue.
These are long duration type projects, they donât turn on and off, and then secondly, there are a lot of mature field type activity that we know would lower exploration risk almost nil exploration risks. Those are projects that create terrific returns for our customers. So I think those two conspire to give you an inelastic sort of outlook.
Jim Wicklund - Credit Suisse
And my follow-up, if I could, thereâs so much the same for in North America. If the US unconventional production starts to decline on an unconventional hyperbolic, the amount of effort it takes to reverse that is huge. So how much activity in the US is needed to maintain not grow, but just maintain existing US production. You all have done that work?
Jeff Miller
Itâs quite a bit of the work thatâs going on now, and I guess Jim the way I would answer that is, rather than give you a percentage, I would say that we know the decline rates on existing wellsâ fairly dramatic. We know what it takes in order to continue to improve that. So I would expect that sustaining activity or sustaining production in North America takes a quite a big chunk of the work thatâs going on now.
Dave Lesar
Jim this is Dave, I would just add one thing and I think we refer to it as sort of the treadmill effect. What you want to do is get your customers in a basin where theyâve got sufficient amount of production that they have to get on the treadmill if you will to keep that production going, because thatâs a great place for a service company to be, and a great place for the lowest cost most efficient service company to be, because helping the customers stay on that treadmill as it gets faster and the incline goes up is part of the whole hyper efficiency model that we try to offer up to our customers.

Our next question comes from Kurt Hallead of RBC Capital Market. Your line is now open.
Kurt Hallead - RBC Capital Market
I just had a follow-up question regarding the frac dynamics in US and you guys have discussed for many quarters now cost recovery process, it seems like that is now beginning to take hold.
Just wondering what your perspective is terms of the incremental capacity thatâs been added recently and whether or not some of that cost recovery can turn in to net pricing gains from an industry standpoint going forward.
Jeff Miller
I canât speak for the industry, but weâll speak for Halliburton, and this is right in our wheel house. As you said recovering inflation has really been the order of the day, but as we go through the renewals and we sort of establish inflationary increases that keep us whole, very quickly we drop back in to our ability to manage cost and drive efficiency which should allow us of it does allow us to convert that inflation in to net pricing to the extent to which we compete at the market, and this precisely why we implement and have advantage and the logistics advantages we have Battle Red, Frac of the Future and thatâs what conspires to deliver our exit rates in excess 20%.

Our next question comes from Doug Becker of Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.
Doug Becker - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch
Mark you mentioned Europe, Africa/ CIS would be relatively flat in the fourth quarter, wanted to confirm that this is for revenues as well as margins. And then just get a little additional color on the growth, or just how that region grows revenues and margins next year given that North Sea revenues are likely down and it would be challenge just to keep Russian revenues flat.
Mark McCollum
The answer is it does relate to both, yes revenues and margins. I mean typically you might see margins climb up a bit on the back of some level of direct sales, completion tool sales, things like that. But I think this quarter given where we are seeing some of the softness particularly the Norwegian sector, the North Sea in Q4 we are expecting it to be more flat to Q3 on both the revenue and the margin side.
Doug Becker - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch
And for next year?
Mark McCollum
Itâs a little early to know for next year where itâs going to go. I mean obviously everything that we are trying to do across the board is to improve margins by cutting cost and things like that. As we look forward to next year, I think we do see some continued softness in the Norwegian sector and the North Sea.
Russia as I said on the call will likely be, hopefully we are working to be flat year-over-year on an overall basis and weâll have Libyaâs down for the count right now, so itâs difficult to forecast when that will be.
But when you look at other markets across Europe, Africa and CIS, you know the Caspian continues to do very well. When you look at sub-Saharan Africa itself, we had a very good year, we expect that will continue to grow on the back of mature field projects there.
And Continental Europe for us is doing exceedingly well right now and we expect that that will go up as well. So as we go in to the year, while a still little bit early in the planning cycle, I would say we are still expecting it to be up and with that we are continuing to leverage incremental margins that are higher than current margins and so we are expecting margins to continue to decline in that area as well, even though it might be able, but less in the Middle East/Asia.

And our final question comes from Waqar Syed of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
Waqar Syed - Goldman Sachs
Mark youâve promised this 500 basis points kind of margin improvement through the course of the years from internal [miles] Frac of the Future and HALvantage. How much of that has already been realized and what is left for the coming years.
Mark McCollum
I would tell you that our goal was to get a 200 basis point improvement in 2014. As of the day we have accomplished that objective. We had hoped that it would be for the entire year Q3, we didnât quite get there, but we were very close.
If it hadnât been for some of logistics challenges that we had in the month of July, we would have indeed had hit that target. So as we look forward, we are comfortable with where we are at, but I can tell you that really on the face of Battle Red we still got a long way to go.
All of our systems are in place, weâve been working out a lot of the kinks in that process, but a lot of the upsights from that project are still in front of us. On the Frac to the Future side we are only still quarter deployed. We got a long way to go in terms of achieving that. So we are going to continue to work a very, very focused and determine lead to make sure that we capture all that upsight.
So as we sit today, we feel very good about our progression and let us know from our standpoint no retreat from our objective of getting 500 basis points over the next couple of years.
Waqar Syed - Goldman Sachs
And them I may have missed that before, but could you quantify the impact of Gulf of Mexico on the D&E margins and revenues for the quarter.
Mark McCollum
I donât know if we could quantify it overall for D&E, but Iâd say that the Gulf of Mexico, the loop current issue probably caused us about a penny in the quarter.
