Pierce Norton
Thanks, Andrew, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. We appreciate your interest and investment in our company. For 32 of my almost 40 year career, I had the good fortune to work with the assets in the people through various companies that are now a part of ONEOK. Iâm excited and honored to be back. This company has a strong experienced management team and a talented workforce, and we are all looking forward to the future.
On todayâs call weâll be discussing ONEOKâs strong performance in the second quarter. And Iâll provide a few of my initial thoughts as to how the management team and I will continue to build on the accomplishments of those that preceded me in this role. Iâm also looking forward to reacquainting or meeting many of you in the near future.
Joining me on todayâs call is, Walt Hulse, the Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President Strategy and Corporate Affairs; and Kevin Burdick, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer. Also available to answer your questions are Sheridan Swords, Senior Vice President, Natural Gas Liquids; and Chuck Kelly, Senior Vice President, Natural Gas.
Iâd like to first start off this call by recognizing and congratulating Terry on his retirement and thanking him for his availability to advise me in my new role. ONEOK has seen tremendous growth and success under Terryâs leadership the last seven years as heâs navigated the company through several growth cycles and industry challenges, including delivering strong results during a pandemic. Terry championed many companiesâ successes. The transition to higher fee based business model with less commodity price exposure, significant improvements in company-wide safety and environmental performance. The successful ONEOK partners merger transaction and the completion of more than $10 billion in capital growth projects, to name just a few of his many accomplishments.
The company has grown in many ways since I was here last, and Iâm looking forward to building on what Terry the Board, the leadership team and ONEOKâs 3000 employees have achieved. Itâs been extraordinary. During this first month on the job, Iâve been re-familiarizing myself with our business, holding strategy and planning meetings with the team, and most importantly, listening. Iâve met with my leadership team and many employees to hear more about their focus areas. These introductions and conversations are very important and weâll continue.
What you can expect from me as a CEO is that we will be disciplined and intentional in all that we do and continue to encourage a culture that promotes safety, reliability, employee engagement, value creation, and environmental responsibility. These principles have served ONEOK well for decades and will continue to be a key element of our daily operations and business decisions going forward. The energy systems today were designed to operate on the consumersâ requirements for affordability, reliability, and resiliency. We will continue to focus on meeting our customersâ needs while also transforming these energy systems to drive the overall lowering of greenhouse gas emissions.
Yesterday we reported a strong second quarter financial result, supported by increasing volumes across our systems. The energy and economic backdrop continues to improve, with producer activity accelerating in demand for NGLs and natural gas strengthening. Kevin will talk more in detail about how weâre addressing those needs, but first, Iâll turn the call over to Walt to discuss our financial performance.
Walt Hulse
Thank you, Pierce. With yesterdayâs earnings announcement, we updated our 2021 financial guidance expectations. Our view of 2021 continues to improve as we now expect 2021 adjusted EBITDA to be above the midpoint of our guidance range of $3.05 billion to $3.35 billion that we provided back in April.
Our outlook for growth in 2022 has continued to strengthen. Higher commodity prices, accelerating producer activity, and the rising gas-to-oil ratio in the Williston Basin, provide a tailwind into next year. With available capacity across our operations and the completion of our Bear Creek plant expansion later this year, significant earnings power remains across our assets without the need for significant capital investment. The strengthening momentum going into 2022 makes us confident that we will achieve or exceed the 2022 outlook we have discussed on previous calls.
Now for a brief overview of our second quarter financial performance. ONEOKâs second quarter 2021 net income totaled $342 million or $0.77 per share. Second quarter adjusted EBITDA totaled $802 million, a 50% increase year-over-year, and a 3% increase compared with the first quarter 2021 after backing out the benefit from Winter Storm Uri. We ended the second quarter with a higher inventory of unfractionated NGLs, due to planned and unplanned outages at some of our fractionation facilities. We expect to recognize $12.5 million of earnings in the second half of 2021 as our current inventory is fractionated, and so the majority of which will be recognized in the third quarter.
Distributable cash flow was $570 million in the second quarter, and dividend coverage was nearly 1.4 times. We generated more than $150 million of distributable cash flow in excess of dividends paid during the quarter.
Our June 30 net debt to EBITDA on an annualized run rate basis was 4.3 times, and we continue to work towards our goal of sub four times. We ended the second quarter with no borrowings outstanding on our $2.5 billion credit facility, and nearly $375 million in cash. In July, the Board of Directors declared a dividend of $0.935 or $3.74 per share on an annualized basis, unchanged from the previous quarter.
Our strong balance sheet, ample liquidity, and increasing EBITDA from volume growth in our system providing solid financial backdrop and flexibility as we enter the second half of the year.
Iâll now turn the call over to Kevin for an operational update.
Kevin Burdick
Thank you, Walt. Our second quarter NGL raw feed throughput and natural gas processing volumes increased compared with the first quarter 2021 driven by increasing producer activity, ethane recovery and gas-to-oil ratios that continue to rise in the Williston Basin.
We expect these tailwinds to carry into the second half of the year and into 2022.
In our Natural Gas Liquids segment, total NGO raw feed throughput volumes increased 17% compared with the first quarter 2021. Second quarter raw feed throughput from the Rocky Mountain region increased 18% compared with the first quarter 2021 and more than 85% compared with the second quarter 2020, which included significant production curtailments resulting from the pandemic.
As a reference point volumes reached approximately 330,000 barrels per day in this region early this month. At this volume level, we still have more than 100,000 barrels per day of NGL pipeline capacity from the region, allowing us to capture increasing volumes on our system, including volume from a new 250 million cubic feet per day third party plant that came online in early July, and expansion of another third party plant that is underway and our Bear Creek plant expansion, which is expected to be complete in the first half of the fourth quarter this year.
Total Mid-Continent region raw feed throughput volumes increased 16% compared with the first quarter 2021 and 10% compared with the second quarter 2020. The Arbuckle II expansion was completed in the second quarter, increasing its capacity up to 500,000 barrels per day, adding additional transportation capacity between the Mid-Continent region and the Gulf Coast.
In the Permian Basin, NGL volumes increased 16% compared with the first quarter 2021, primarily as a result of increased ethane recovery and producer activity. Petrochemical demand continues to strengthen and is seen support from a continuing global pandemic recovery. This led to increased ethane recovery across our system in the second quarter. Ethane volumes on our system in the Rocky Mountain region increased compared with the first quarter 2021 as we continue to incent some ethane recovery on a short term basis. Continued ethane recovery in the Rockies in the second half of 2021 will depend on regional natural gas and ethane pricing. We have not included ethane recovery from the Rockies for the remainder of the year in our updated financial guidance.
Ethane volumes on our Mid-Continent system increased compared with the first quarter 2021 due to both favorable recovery economics and some incentivized recovery. We continue to forecast partial ethane recovery in our guidance for the second half of the year in this region.
Ethane volumes in the Permian Basin increased in the second quarter compared with the first quarter 2021. We continue to expect the basin to be in near full recovery in the second half of the year.
Discretionary ethane on our system or said differently, the amount of ethane that we estimate could be operationally recovered at any given time, but is not economic to recover at current prices without incentives is approximately 225,000 barrels per day. Of that total opportunity, 125,000 barrels per day are available in the Rocky Mountain region and 100,000 barrels per day in the Mid-Continent. Full recovery in the Rockies region would provide an opportunity for $500 million in annual adjusted EBITDA at full rates.
Moving on to the Natural Gas Gathering and Processing segment; in the Rocky Mountain region second quarter processed volumes averaged more than 1.25 billion cubic feet per day, an increase of 6% compared with the first quarter 2021 and more than 50% year-over-year. An outage at one of our plants, which has since come back online decreased second quarter volumes by approximately 15 million cubic feet per day. Toward the end of June volumes reached 1.3 billion cubic feet per day and we have line of sight to even higher processed volumes later in the year given the recent increase in completion crews and rigs in the basin.
Conversations with our producers in the region continue to point to higher activity levels in the second half of 2021 and 2022 particularly in Dunn County, where construction on our Bear Creek processing plant is on track for completion in the first half of the fourth quarter of this year. Once in service, we will have approximately 1.7 billion cubic feet per day of processing capacity in the basin, and weâll be able to grow our volumes with minimal capital.
In the second quarter, we connected 84 wells in the Rocky Mountain region and still expect to connect more than 300 this year. Based on the most recent producer completion schedules, we expect a significant increase in well connects in the second half of the year, with some producers aligning the timing of well completions closer to the completion of Bear Creek. There are currently 23 rigs operating in the basin with nine on our dedicated acreage and there continues to be a large inventory drilled, but uncompleted wells with more than 650 basin wide and approximately 325 on our dedicated acreage.
We expect the current DUC inventory to get worked down before we see producers bring back more rigs to the basin to replenish inventory levels. As we said last quarter, the eight completion crews currently operating in the basin is enough to reach our well connect guidance for the year. Any additional completion crews would present upside to our guidance.
Rising gas-to-oil ratios and natural gas flaring in the basin continue to present opportunities for volume growth without the need for additional producer activity. Since 2016, GORs have increased more than 75%. Recent projections from the North Dakota Pipeline Authority show that even in a flat crude oil production environment, GORs could increase an additional 45% in the next seven years. This could add 1.3 billion cubic feet per day of gas production and approximately 150,000 barrels per day of C3+ NGL volume to the basin during that same time period. Again, this growth in natural gas is only based on increasing GORs and assumes flat crude oil production. Any growth in crude oil would be upside to those projections. Weâve added a new slide in our earnings materials to show these latest North Dakota projections, which include various production scenarios.
During the second quarter, the gathering and processing segment average fee rates increased to $1.06 per MMBtu driven by higher Rocky Mountain region volumes. We now expect the fee rate for 2021 to average between $1 and $1.05 per MMBtu.
Mid-Continent region average process volumes increased 4% compared with the first quarter 2021 as volumes returned following freeze-offs in the first quarter. While the region has received some attention as commodity prices strengthen, producer activity has been more moderate than other areas.
In the natural gas pipeline segment, the segment reported a solid quarter of stable fee based earnings. The decrease in earnings year-over-year was driven by a onetime contract settlement that provided a $13.5 million benefit to earnings in the second quarter of 2020. We continue to see increased interest from our customers for additional long-term transportation and storage capacity on our system, following the extreme winter weather events earlier this year. Since the first quarter, we have renewed or recontracted additional long-term storage capacity in both Texas and Oklahoma, including a successful open season for more than 1 billion cubic feet of incremental firm storage capacity at our West Texas storage assets. Weâll continue to work with customers to contract additional long-term capacity as we head into the winter heating season.
Pierce, that concludes my remarks.
Pierce Norton
Thank you, Kevin. The results achieved so far this year, only 12 months removed from the unprecedented conditions in the second quarter of 2020 are nothing short of amazing. Resiliency of our assets and our employees and the caliber of our customers, weâre able to work with and provide a long-term runway of many opportunities. But key to our success will continue to be operating safely, sustainably and responsibly with the health and safety of our communities and employees at the forefront of all that we do. To learn more about our commitment to responsible operations, I encourage you to review our most recent corporate sustainability report, which was just published to our website last week.
The report details our most recent environmental, social and governance related to performance and programs and highlights key initiatives under way across the company. Its ONEOK employees, who carry out these initiatives every day, and who prioritize the safety and well being of their fellow employees, customers and the public. Thank you for your continued hard work and your dedication to safety to this company.
Again, Iâm excited to be back at ONEOK, and Iâm looking forward to the opportunities and the challenges ahead.
Operator weâre now ready for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Weâll take our first question from Shneur Gershuni with UBS.
Shneur Gershuni
Hi, good morning everyone. Pierce, nice to hear your voice on a different conference call and Iâd like to send a congratulations to Terry on a very successful career and congrats on starting a new chapter.
Maybe to position and so Pierce to put you on the hot spot, hot seat right off the back here. But I was wondering if we can talk about your thoughts around buybacks in CapEx for 2022. I imagine thereâs not much on the CapEx front, just sort of given where you are at this point right now. Maybe a completion of the frozen frac is two inches with the higher ethane recovery that in Kevinâs comments about C3+, with respect to GORs, but outside of that doesnât appear to be much on the CapEx side, when itâs different take the soft outlooks that have been presented in the past $3.5 billion to $4 billion has kind of been thrown around into potential 2022 run rate. It sort of suggests itâs the leverage for what I was going to be some four times leverage ratio target. This is set up for buybacks in 2022? If so, how should we think about execution around buybacks? Or if I got the thought process online on CapEx? Just curious on your thoughts.
Pierce Norton
So, Shneur, first of all, thank you for the welcome back. And we will certainly pass on your comments to Terry. And I think we all echo those as well. And weâll make some kind of a broad comment, and then Iâm going to let Walt kind of answer kind of more specifically. But weâre in the process of looking at our strategic plan and our earnings projection, not only for 2022, but also for the next five years. As a part of that, weâll be assessing what I would consider, our capital allocation opportunities. So, I donât have a specific answer to, exactly for the buybacks for next year. But I would say thatâs all a part of our capital allocation plan and the strategy that weâre actually currently talking about now. So, Iâd like Walt to kind of weigh in on any more particulars that any insights that he might have.
Walt Hulse
Sure. Thanks Pierce. Well, Shneur basically, I would agree with your assessment of the tailwinds that are behind our business today. And weâre excited about the opportunities that are forward and the cash flows that will generate from that weâll continue to enhance our de-leveraging strategy thatâs been in place for quite some time. And weâre starting to see some of our end goals in the near term coming forward. And as we get closer to our goals of sub four times leverage, then obviously, we will expand the horizon of things that weâll look at from a capital allocation. And I think we spent time with Pierce, weâll look at all of our options. As we go forward.
Youâre right that there isnât any major CapEx project on the horizon here are we really doubled the capacity of our long-haul pipes and the NGL business over the last several years. And that gives us a lot of running room going forward, you highlighted that we have a couple of projects that we pause back with a pandemic. And over the course of, next year or two is, as producer activity picks up, I would assume that weâll likely clean some of those up and finish them up to meet our customersâ needs. But itâs really going to be routine growth than some smaller growth projects that are very attractive going forward. So, weâll have plenty of free cash flow to continue to de-leverage and then look at all of those capital allocation opportunities over the next couple of years.
Shneur Gershuni
Really appreciate the detail color there. And maybe as a follow up question here, just given the fact that that Terryâs been at the company for so long, and so effective [ph] strategy and so forth Pierce youâre coming in now, how are things going to change? How are they going to stay the same with respect to strategy? Would there any specific marching orders that were given to you from the board upon your arrival? Just kind of curious if you can sort of talk to that kind of holistically?
Pierce Norton
Sure, Iâll be glad to answer that. I think itâs not so much about, whatâs going to change immediately in the company. I think itâs more about whatâs changing in the energy industry, I think we can probably all agree that the energy systems across the United States, itâs going to be very important that we continue to transition into a lower carbon energy system across United States. So really, itâs about how we at ONEOK and the assets, and the people in the skill sets that we have, are actually going to transform with that energy system.
I view that as a three step process, first of all, you got to understand, what the transformation of the energy systems look like then you prepare for that, for what youâve learned and what you understand. And then you innovate. And I think thatâs the three focus areas that I would say that we have going forward is understanding, where we are preparing and innovating for the future, while at the same time continuing to grow the base business that we have in the use of natural gas and natural gas liquids, because I think the global poll, most countries are not where we are in the United States as far as the maturity of our systems and the transparency that we have in the energy systems here in the United States. So think thatâs going to continue to pull for natural gas demand as well as natural gas liquids growth, while at the same time weâre going to be able to use the skill sets and the talents that we have in our company to transform.
I do think transformation is a better word than transition. Transition, to me indicates that youâre going to leave one thing and go to another transformation. In my opinion, it means that youâre going to use something that you have, and maybe use it a little bit slightly different, in the future to meet some of the problems that we have, I do think itâs important for the United States to lead in the effort of lower carbon, because I think the other parts of the world can learn from what we do, although thereâs only 6.6 gigatons of CO2 emissions in the United States versus 51 gigatons over the globe. So weâre a small percentage, but I think itâs important for the U.S. to lead in these efforts. And, and I do feel like that, ONEOK is positioned. Over a long period of time, a lot of these things, as you look at CNG and hydrogen and LNG for long-haul and carbon sequestration and capturing methane, those are all going to be opportunities that we experienced over the next several decades.
Shneur Gershuni
Great. Really appreciate the color and congratulations on the new role.
Pierce Norton
Well, thank thanks again.
Operator
Our next question comes from Christine Cho with Barclays.
Christine Cho
Thank you, Pierce. Welcome back to this side of ONEOK. I thought I would maybe start with an ethane question. This quarter, you guys took out more ethane in the back end. And you talk about 25,000 barrels a day of ethane extraction being an incremental $100 million. But thatâs predicated on you collecting the full $0.28 TNF. You havenât been collecting that when youâre doing it more opportunistically and when you do provide more ethane to the market this way, it sort of puts a lid on what prices can be so curious, how do you balance this and make sure you donât provide too much supply that it negatively impacts a frac spread economics and other basins that youâre in? And what really has to happen in order for producers to sign up for long-term contracts for ethane TNF out of the back end? Is it really only a firm Btu resolution on northern border?
Pierce Norton
Christine, thanks for the Welcome back. And I think Kevin and Sheridan can probably add more pillar to your question.
Sheridan Swords
Sure. Christine this is Sheridan. I think in your first question on how do we determine how much ethane to bring out of the Bakken and whatâs the right amount before putting a lid on ethane prices, really, when we try to understand is, where the next incremental ethane will come out and is that coming off our system or somebody elseâs system. And so if we donât bring it out of our system that somebody else can bring ethane out of their side of the system when we will lose the whole uplift that weâll have from buying it at gas and selling it at ethane value. So itâs an ongoing process that we look at every month and we try to make that determination thatâs why we donât bring all the ethane now at the Bakken that we could. We could incentivize more. But we just bring what we feel is the right amount of ethane to come out.
And really on your question of what would it take for producers sign up for ethane they have already signed up for ethane. They have the option today whether or not to bring ethane on the system or not to bring ethane on the system, we have the capacity for them. And they signed up for a certain amount of capacity. What it really comes down to now is what is going to drive the price high enough that we get a full TNF rate or the full $0.28 to bring that the ethane would come out. And whatâs going to need to happen for that as youâre going to need to continue to have a strong ethane to ethylene spread like we have today very, very widespread. So that ethane can continue to rise, prices continue to rise. And the petchems can continue to make money off of that.
The second thing is you need to have more demand. And then we need to see more exports coming out there is more export capacity out there and we need to see more crackers and in the second quarter of next year, the ExxonMobil, SABIC crackers going to come online as well. So thatâs going to bring on more demand. And I think the third thing you need to look at is you need to look at regional gas prices between the Bakken and other areas. So, if we would see the Bakken gas prices dip down like we typically see in the summer, I think all those things together if they work that you have the possibility of an opportunity to see ethane come out that Bakken at full prices.
Christine Cho
Got it. That was really helpful. And then I guess just moving over to I guess guidance. On a prior quarter call you guys kind of gave us off 2022 guidance of about $3.4 billion. Are you guys still feeling good about this? And what sort of ethane extraction assumptions or are you including in that?
Pierce Norton
So Christine, Iâll start by saying, we havenât issued our 2022 guidance yet. Weâre in the process of looking at that. But I will let Walt or Kevin chime in on that past comment.
Kevin Burdick
Yes, Christine. I mean, I think, when we were still that number still out there that we talked about it as far as where weâd be in 2022. And since the last quarter, nothing, weâve âeverything strengthened since that time. I mean, prices have strengthened, the comments and the feedback we get from our producers have strengthened so thatâs the way I would frame 2022 up is, it is definitely more constructive today than it was three months ago.
Christine Cho
Got it. Thank you.
Operator
Our next question will come from Tristan Richardson with Truist Securities.
Tristan Richardson
Hey, good morning, guys. Really appreciate the comments and kind of what youâre seeing in the second half. And particularly the comment on July, I think you noted, maybe at one point in time the system touched 330 a day is that including some recovery or at least incentivized recovery. So, are you seeing some recovery in the Rockies starting in the second half?
Kevin Burdick
Yes, Tristan, this is Kevin. Yes, that would include some incentivized recovery, which we talked about in the remarks.
Tristan Richardson
Okay. I appreciate Kevin. And then lastly, Walt I think you in the past have talked about the earnings engine at ONEOK and the potential for this business to produce EBITDA, the four handle? I mean, without asking you about a timeframe or anything, can you talk about some of the conditions necessary to hit that type of potential? And are you seeing some of that, as you look out over the near and medium term?
Kevin Burdick
Well, I think that the way weâd frame that up in the past was that we have the assets in place, especially in the Bakken to achieve those types of earnings levels without any meaningful need for CapEx. As you continue to see gas volumes there, maybe at some point in the future, a need for another plant up there, but thatâs not in the near term, weâve got plenty of capacity and McKenzie County and now weâre going to have capacity down in Dunn County. So, weâve got room to run, and weâve got room to run on the NGL side. As we get closer to those numbers that would start with a four, weâre probably going to have to have some downstream additions that, like MB-5, and things like that, that would need to be completed. But none of those are major dollars in the scheme of the earnings power of the company. So, weâre pretty excited about, kind of the operating leverage that we have in the company, and the ability to continue to grow significantly with modest capital needs.
Tristan Richardson
Appreciate it. Thank you guys very much.
Pierce Norton
Welcome. 
Kevin Burdick
Thank you.
Operator
Our next question will come from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan.
Jeremy Tonet
Hi, good morning.
Pierce Norton
Good morning Jeremy.
Kevin Burdick
Hi, Jeremy.
Jeremy Tonet
I also want to send Terry our best going forward into retirement their best of luck. Maybe picking up on energy transformation, as you laid out there, RNG Biofuels, Hydrogen CCUS. Just wondering if thereâs any specific initiatives that ONEOK is working on right now seems like thereâs some things done the RNG side, but just wondering specifically right now, if thereâs anything, near medium term opportunities that ONEOK is focused on.
Pierce Norton
Thank you. I picked up on probably the one that is probably the most likely the quickest. And that is the renewable gas opportunities primarily coming from; these are kind of listed in order of agriculture, wastewater and landfills. Iâm going to kick it over to Chuck there just a second, because he can give you some updates on what weâre doing, as it relates to some of the RNG efforts, but the CNG and LNG for the long-haul, I think is another thing that could be a possibility. Hydrogen is probably out into the future because primarily in right now, you canât take a certain amount of hydrogen based on the tariffs on the interstate and intrastate assets across the United States.
But I do think thatâs a developing opportunity left to be seen, economically, how that stuff plays off. And then you got carbon sequestration, because 24% of all the carbon emitted of the 6.6 gigatons actually comes from electric generation from coal, oil and natural gas, primarily, coal and natural gas. So, I think thatâs going to be important to solve that equation. And of course, transportation has about 28% of that 6.6 gigatons. So, if you converted all the cars today to EVs, then you just switch the problem from transportation over to electric generation and then so you didnât really solve the problem. So Chuck, Iâm going to let you kind of talk a little bit about our RNG opportunities and what weâve already done and are doing.
Chuck Kelly
Sure, Pierce. So, itâs a little color, Jeremy on our interstate pipes, particularly if you think about where theyâre located Upper Midwest, weâve got, as you know, quite a few dairy farms up in that area. So, you have agricultural waste, weâve connected three RNG facilities that are originated from dairy farms already up there, looking at another one. And then here on our intrastate business, particularly in Oklahoma, weâve already connected a large landfill waste site recycling facility, looking at another and then of course, thereâs some large feedlots in our Texas intrastate markets. So, weâve been involved in connecting RNG and bringing that gas into our stream, delivering it to customers downstream. So this has been ongoing over the past three years, and weâre seeing that accelerate, so excited by the RNG aspects that we see out there.
Pierce Norton
So and I just kind of summarize that by saying that, as part of our strategic plan, we look to develop, business plans around all these different aspects of these opportunities. But I think, more importantly, as far as it what these opportunities do? Is they make the existing natural gas pipelines in the United States, relevant. Instead of just moving methane that you traditionally get from the wellheads, youâre actually capturing methane that is emitted to the air, which is 25 times more potent than the CO2, so you get to see, uplift in the CO2 equivalents. And so you get the extra benefit of removing that. And youâre using existing assets to help other industries reduce their environmental footprint. So the relevancy of it is the important part as opposed to some great business opportunity, to boost your EBITDA. Itâs really designed around the relevancy of making essentially 2.6 million miles of pipelines in the United States are very important to the energy transformation future.
Jeremy Tonet
Thatâs very helpful. Thanks and just want to follow up a little bit as it relates to CCUS because it seems like North Dakota is kind of separate themselves, from what all the states given the multiple initiatives there for CCUS with power generation, for actually having primacy on the classics wells, and really kind of solving that problem, streamlining it, and then kind of really proving up quite a sizable sequesteration resource within the state. And just given your positioning in North Dakota was wondering if you see an opportunity for ONEOK to play a role in all these development teams, like, since it seems like things are moving more real time in North Dakota, than other parts of the country.
Kevin Burdick
Definitely. Interesting. This is Kevin, we absolutely see that as an opportunity. And our â and it started and itâs been in with our presence up there. Weâve got strong relationships with state university systems, et cetera and are involved in projects and analysis to understand the Class 6 permits, that that much of the storage has up there, the ability that that puts you further ahead for those opportunities. So, we are definitely involved in those conversations and have a long history and track record of partnering with the state and would expect that to continue as it relates to CCUS.
Jeremy Tonet
Got it. Great this Jeremy, thank you so much for taking the questions.

Our next question will come from Michael Blum with Wells Fargo.
Michael Blum
Thanks. I just want to add welcome back, Pierce as well.
Pierce Norton
Thank you, Michael.
Michael Blum
I wanted to go back to the Bakken for a minute. And you kind of touched on some of this, but just ask them more directly. How much ethane are you voluntarily recovering in the Bakken today? And it looks to us at least like the Btu limits are either closed or have been returned northern border. So, do you envision at some point here in voluntarily recovering ethane out of the Bakken.
Kevin Burdick
Michael, this is Kevin, weâre not going to, we said last quarter, weâre not going to get into and talk about the actual volume of ethane weâre recovering. Other than to say we have incented some methane to come out. Thatâs been economic driven, with that ethane recovery, thatâs actually pulling down the Btu level on Northern border. So itâs maybe pushing that out a little bit. But if you just go back to the gross kind of production growth, that rather itâs GORs or activity levels that are both increasing.
At some point, we continue to believe itâs just math that blended Btu rate is going to go up and become a problem. Northern border or TransCanada continues to have discussions with the various partners and counterparties up there, both on the supply side and the demand side, to understand what a Btu spec might look like. And we expect those conversations with the counterparties and FERC to continue and hopefully weâll have something, resolution here in the next several months.
Michael Blum
Got it. Thanks for that. The other question I wanted to ask was about the Mid-Continent NGL volumes, it looks like they were up sequentially. Just want to make sure I understand is that being driven by just the Arbuckle II expansion because the G&P segment there in the Mid-Con. You cited production decline. So, I just wonder [ph] understanding the dynamics there. Thanks.
Sheridan Swords
Michael, this is Sheridan. Obviously the Arbuckle II expansion helps us move those volumes. Weâre really what weâre seeing is we did incentivize the methane in the Mid-Continent more in the second quarter than we did in the first quarter, but weâre also seeing some increased producer activity. So, weâve seen our C3+ volumes increase as well, and weâre probably back to a level that on the C3+ volumes that is equivalent to pretty close to where we were in the fourth quarter of 2019. So, weâve seen some pretty good recovery from the pandemic, recovery from the ice storm and some growth. Weâre seeing a little bit of activity there. Now, weâre predicting that the Mid-Continent will stay relatively flat this year going forward, that we have seen a little uptick in volume.
Michael Blum
Great, thank you very much.

Weâll take our next question from Becca Followill with U.S. Capital Advisors.
Becca Followill
Hi, Guys, and welcome back, Pierce.
Pierce Norton
Thank you, Becca.
Becca Followill
Thank you. First question is on the fee rate on GMP, itâs up to $1.06 keeps ticking higher. It looks like the mix continues to be where and I realize its mixed dependent. But it looks like the mix continues to be where the Bakkenâs going to grow faster than the Mid-Continent. So should we expect that to continue to take higher or is $1.06 kind of a cap here?
Chuck Kelly
Becca, this is Chuck. I think in Kevinâs remarks, we talked about $1 to $1.05 range, we still believe that somewhere in that $1.05 ranges is a probably a good number for the balance of the year. The $1.06 was a little stronger than we thought it would be frankly, and it was driven really by the contract mix on the Bakken.
Becca Followill
Okay. Thank you. And then the second oneâs on LPG export facilities. Youâve talked, I think pre-COVID it was you talked about it. But weâve got NGL that hit record levels in May in the U.S. Any current thoughts on an NGL export facility for you guys?
Kevin Burdick
Becca itâs Kevin. We continue to look at it, it remains a priority for us it is continued there. Clearly the pandemic and the pullback in production, slowed down, some of those discussions, but like you mentioned with exports continuing to be very strong through this and production picking back up. So have the conversation. And so we will continue to look at that. And once as we said before, rather weâre talking LPG or ethane. If we get the right counterparties, the right project and then weâll announce something, but still looking at it. And itâs still a priority for us.
Becca Followill
Thank you.

Our next question will be taken from Spiro Dounis with Credit Suisse.
Spiro Dounis
Good morning team. First one well, sorry, if I missed that [Technical Difficulty].
Pierce Norton
Spiro you breaking up a little, if you could say whatever youâre saying over again, please.
Spiro Dounis
[Technical Difficulty] CapEx range curious thatâs trending in a direction either. But imagine a lot of the higher activity levels are pushing that higher, but maybe not the case.
Pierce Norton
Okay, I think I got it that youâre looking at CapEx in 2021. We continue to stay within our range. Obviously, as producer activity picks up, weâre going to spend a little bit more on well connect. So that might move us towards the higher end of the range. But weâre very comfortable with the 2021 range that we have out there at this point.
Spiro Dounis
Just M&A will be helpful here. I know in the past, youâve expressed interest on some of the gas assets that were being marketed by some of the utilities out there. Weâve seen some of those change hands at this point. So, curious if thereâs still assets out there that could enter [Technical Difficulty]
Pierce Norton
So screw up, just make a broad comment about M&A, itâs been about 30 years in the midstream business, and thereâs always been some level of M&A activity. It did slow down during the years where most of the assets were into the MLPs. But I guess, what I would say about that is, Iâve only been back for 30 days. And Iâd point you back to the comments that that I made on the â in the original opening that whatever we do its going to be intentional. Itâs going to be disciplined. So, whether or not we do or donât participate in the M&A market thatâs going to be our guiding principles.
Spiro Dounis
Understood. So Pierce, congrats and good luck to Terry.
Pierce Norton
Thanks.

Our next question will come from Jean Ann Salisbury with Bernstein.
Jean Ann Salisbury 
Is there still any ethane being rejected and the Mid-Con? Or is this number for the volume kind of all potential ethane from the Mid-Con, but as you know that 100,000 of it is sort of discretionarily being recovered?
Sheridan Swords
This is Sheridan. There still is some ethane being rejected in the Mid-Continent. But hereâs we get into August, that number is quite low. We think weâre at are getting close to full ethane recovery in the Mid-Continent right now. But for the second quarter, we did still have quite a bit of ethane off in the Mid-Continent. And so we did incentivize some in the Mid-Continent. In the second quarter in August, we have very little that we are incentivizing out.
Jean Ann Salisbury 
Thatâs really helpful. Thank you. And then that new Slide 9 with the gas production at flat Bakken create, is really interesting. This would suggest an ad of like a Bcfd, from here over the next five years, even if oil production is just flat. But thereâs obviously not anywhere near a Bcfd of gas takeaway left out of the Bakken. How do you see this has been resolved? And would you participate in this solution for that, if thatâs what it took?
Kevin Burdick
Yes, Jean Ann this is Kevin. Yes, thatâs something weâll absolutely keep an eye on. I mean, the good thing there is, weâve got time. You still got some capacity on northern border that can be you can displace Canadian gas. Going back pre-pandemic, we had talked about looking at other avenues out whether that was expansions on northern border, or moving gas to the west and taking advantage of existing assets that are in the ground, to go to the west and south. So, my guess is those things would come back up, weâll have those conversations as we see volumes materialize. But the good thing is, we do have some time. And weâve got some available capacity to get us to that point.
Jean Ann Salisbury 
Great. Thatâs all for me. Thank you.

Our next question comes from Craig Shere with Tuohy Brothers.
Craig Shere
Morning team. Pierce, welcome back, and congrats to Terry on retirement in job well done. Historically, there was some interest in getting into the crude gathering and transportation. Are you just so gangbusters on the wet gas and NGLs that this is kind of off the table at the moment? Or how does this look going forward?
Pierce Norton
So Craig, I think our core business is pretty well defined with natural gas and natural gas liquids. And thatâs the direction I would see in the future.
Craig Shere
Very good. And just what kind of running room do we have for increased Mid-Con firm capacity demand to avoid further winter market dislocations, in terms of maybe ongoing steady state EBITDA with that could reduce volatility in the Mid-Con.
Pierce Norton
Let me kind of rewind this back to Winter Storm Uri, because I saw that up close and personal. And the Mid-Continent area, which is defined as Southwest Kansas and the Texas Panhandle and Oklahoma, is a net exporter of natural gas, even during the month of February during the middle of winter to the tune of about three Bcf a day. That turned back between the demand that we saw in the Mid-Continent and the lack of production for various reasons to basically only 5% exports. So, the real issue is to talk about resiliency of the supply chain and how we can potentially get gas in those kind of situations back from maybe the South East, up into the Mid-Continent if it ever happens again. So those are things that that we would be looking at, but it really is looking at not necessarily the capacity thatâs there today or the contracting of that capacity. We are addressing a little bit of that which is some uptick in storage and some additional volumes there. But thatâs not going to get you through a second Winter Storm Uri. So itâs going to have to be a holistic approach between the exploration and production folks, the midstream folks and the utilities to really get us to a point where we can take on another Winter Storm Uri.
Weâll say volumetrically, there were very, very few customers lost in the state of Oklahoma. And so that volumetrically was a very positive force. The issue was where the price went to, not necessarily the stability and the reliability of being able to perform. So, I think the focus needs to be on resiliency and thereâs going to be a lot of people thatâs going to be involved in that process.
Craig Shere
Can this process de-risk some of the Mid-Con EBITDA?
Kevin Burdick
Craig, this is Kevin, I think, those assets are highly contracted and have been highly contracted for a long time. And we would expect that to continue. So, I think what this does is maybe provide opportunities for expansion. This team has done a really good job of whether itâs connecting new power plants or doing smaller projects to bring gas from other areas, to Pierceâs comments, weâve done some of that. We just think there may be more opportunities for that in the future.
Craig Shere
Right, thank you.

Our next question will come from Michael Cusimano with Pickering Energy Partners.
Michael Cusimano
Good morning, everyone and congrats on the new roles. I have more of a strategic question. Hypothetically, using Elk Creek 540,000 barrels a day of expandable capacity is kind of a ceiling being filled by even like the 330 touched on earlier this month and the 125,000 barrels a day of available esteem that you mentioned. It still leaves is that 85,000 of capacity available for the GOR and volume growth opportunities that you mentioned. So with that in mind, Iâm trying to understand the strategic rationale for overland pass today. Is that just there capacity available for potential growth beyond Elk Creek? If you can mention â just talk about just how that fits into the portfolio today?
Sheridan Swords
Yes, this is Sheridan. I think when you think about the strategic rationale OPPL you need to think about Elk Creek as one system. And the Bakken pipeline delivered into OPPL as a second system. So to reach the total 540,000 barrels a day of capacity that we could achieve by expanding Elk Creek, Elk Creek will run 400,000 of that the other 140 will be on the Bakken pipeline and delivering that into OPPL and delivering all that into business so thatâs where OPPL fits into our strategic plan for volumes out of the Bakken.
Michael Cusimano
Okay. So okay, so it was more of thinking of Elk Creek from Rockies, before it touches into were open to well connect thatâs more of like a 400,000 barrels a day capacity?
Sheridan Swords
It is, if we would put the additional pumps on. Right now, we stated that thatâs 300,000.
Michael Cusimano
Okay, perfect. Yes, thatâs really helpful. Thank you.

Our next question comes from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.
Michael Lapides
Hey, guys want to wish Terry a congrats, and Pierce, congrats to you as well look forward to getting together at some point. Have a volume question, you made the comment â someone made the comment on the call about 330,000 barrels a day is kind of what youâre seeing right now out of the Bakken. Can you give same data points for what youâre seeing right now in the Mid-Con and in the Permian relative to kind of what the second quarter run rate, I think on Slide 4 was?
Pierce Norton
We â I havenât looked specifically at what weâre running right now. I will say that we are running higher on both those systems than we did in the second quarter. But I have a specific look at what we have reached on each one of these systems. But we are running â we are turning higher on both of those systems.
Michael Lapides
Got it. And when I look at your guidance, your volumetric guidance across G&P in NGL throughput? Do you think thereâs material upside to this little surprise given todayâs numbers and then the comment on the 330,000 that you didnât kind of do a volumetric guidance raise here?
Kevin Burdick
Well, Michael, weâre still within â this is Kevin. Weâre still within the range in both segments. I mean, clearly, as we see strengthening activity that youâd see some â there would definitely be some upside to those numbers. But the other dynamic thatâs going on is, when you look at an annual average, you had a pretty tough first quarter with the winter storm as it related to volumes. So, I do think youâre going to see a much stronger volume in the second half of the year than you did in the first half, but still tracking inside the guidance at this point.
Michael Lapides
Got it. Super helpful. And then last question just on frac capacity, can you talk about and I know you had the outage this period. So it may be a little hard? What the utilization of your fracs are and when you actually think the earliest you might need new capacity would be?
Pierce Norton
Well, right now, the utilization of our fracs is as much as we can get through them, because weâre trying to frac off that backlog of inventory that we had carryover from the second quarter as we go forward. In terms of adding new frac capacity, weâre continuing to evaluate that weâre seeing good strong volume growth in our in our area, weâre trying to understand when the right time is to kick that project off. And weâre hoping that volumes continue to grow. And we can see that come up pretty quick.
Sheridan Swords
But Michael, I would just add that add that capacity, all we would be doing is completing MB-5, and youâre just talking a couple $100 million to finish up that project.
Michael Lapides
Got it. But is that something you think could be needed next year? Or do you think itâs more longer term down the road?
Pierce Norton
Well, it possibly could be needed next year, I think when we get it up, itâll take a little bit longer than that to get it up and going. So, thatâs why we kind of need to look at longer than a year ago probably take a little bit longer than that to get it up to complete what we need to have done there. But thereâs a possibility it could be needed next year. But still, I still steal thereâs quite a bit of capacity in the industry right now that outside frac deals could be done in the short-term.
Michael Lapides
Got it? Thank you guys. Much appreciate it.

Weâll take our final question from Sunil Sibal with Seaport Global Securities.
Sunil Sibal
Yes, hi. Good afternoon, everybody, and welcome back to Pierce and then also congrats to Terry on his retirement. A couple of quick questions for me, seems like there has been a fair bit of debate between the activity levels, public versus private. Could you remind us, how much of your volumes come from private producers versus public producers in Bakken?
Pierce Norton
Weâve got â obviously, weâve got the big, thereâs a lot of publics out there when you think about ConocoPhillips, and Continental and ExxonMobil, and so forth. So the majority of those are coming from the publicâs up in the Bakken. But we do have some of our smaller customers are the privates, but we really havenât seen a distinguishing factor between whoâs bringing rigs back, itâs really more an independent company, just depending on what their financial situation is, and how theyâre viewing their balance sheet, et cetera. But pretty much across the board, we have seen all those customers talk about increasing activity as we move through the rest of this year into 2022.
Sunil Sibal
Got it, thanks for that. And then seems like, when I look at Q2 versus Q1, you had a fairly decent uptick in volumes, but your OpEx were flattish to lower sequentially. I was curious, is there any specific thing which is driving that? And how should we be thinking about your OpEx going forward?
Pierce Norton
No, I think, weâve had a couple quarters of a pretty close run rate here. We grow from sequential quarter-to-quarter. It was really just some timing, coming out of the winter, being able to â starting to execute on some expense projects that that will typically do and as the weather gets better, and that some of that was occurring in the NGL segment. But as we think going forward, other than maybe a little uptick with Bear Creek when it becomes operational later this year, other than that, kind of the current run rate would probably be a decent number to use.
Sunil Sibal
Go got it. Thanks.
