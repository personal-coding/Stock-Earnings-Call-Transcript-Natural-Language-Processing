Now, I'll turn the call over to Waste Management's President and CEO, David Steiner.
David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Thanks, Ed, and good morning from Houston. We're very pleased that we earned $0.49 per share in the first quarter, an increase of almost 9% from our 2014 first quarter results, when adjusted to exclude the earnings from divested businesses and assets. Our EPS increased despite $0.03 of year-over-year headwinds from lower recycling commodity prices and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency fluctuation.
Our field and corporate teams overcame those headwinds through continued improvement in our pricing and cost control programs. This led to growth in income from operations, operating EBITDA, margins and free cash flow and marked a strong start to 2015. These results were in line with our internal expectations and we expect to see continued improvement as we progress throughout the year.
During the first quarter, we reinvested a portion of the proceeds from the sale of our waste-to-energy business. We completed the acquisition of Deffenbaugh Disposal at a pre-synergy operating EBITDA multiple of just under 8. Once fully integrated, the acquisition should add about $52 million of annual operating EBITDA.
On the acquisition front, we continue to have discussion with sellers, but we'll remain disciplined and not overpay for assets. If we cannot identify core businesses to acquire at reasonable prices, we'll buy the business that we know the best, ours, by doing a share buyback. Even if we do identify acquisition targets at reasonable prices, we will still purchase at least enough shares to offset dilution and we'll begin buying those shares in the second quarter.
Turning back to our operations, our pricing programs continued to drive earnings growth and margin expansion. For the first quarter, our collection and disposal core price was 4.4% and yield was 2%. We've now seen eight consecutive quarters of yield at 2% or better. In the first quarter of 2015, each of our lines of business had positive yield.
In the first quarter, we also saw core price improve 20 basis points from the first quarter of 2014 to the highest level that we've achieved. We also saw the highest core price ever in each of the commercial, industrial and landfill lines of business
Core price in the industrial line was 9.4%, 6.6% in the commercial line, 2.3% in our landfill line, and 2.1% in our residential line. This is a tremendous accomplishment by our team in light of depressed CPI levels.
So, we continue to use core price to drive margin expansion. And in the first quarter, our traditional solid waste business income from operations margin increased 110 basis points and our operating EBITDA margin increased 130 basis points. Clearly, the trade-off of emphasizing core price over obtaining lower margin volume remains very positive for us.
Turning to volumes, our traditional solid waste volumes declined 1.2% in the first quarter of 2015 versus a decline of 3.2% in 2014. We saw some very positive trends in our commercial and industrial lines of business.
The losses in our commercial volumes improved 200 basis points from the first quarter of 2014 and industrial volume losses improved 520 basis points. Both the commercial and industrial lines of business saw the lowest rate of decline in seven quarters. So the volume trends are very positive.
The revenue trend was not as positive but it reflects the loss of low margin work that we intentionally shed. Total company volumes declined $95 million or 3% in the first quarter. The overall volume decline stems from a $51 million decline in national account contracts and residential business as we shed this low-margin business consistent with our revenue strategy.
We also saw a $43 million decline in our commodity-driven businesses from lower-recycling commodity sales driven by the West Coast port slowdown, and to a lesser extent, lower landfill gas-to-energy sales. Consequently, although total volumes are down more than we expected, it's due primarily to volumes in lower margin lines of business while the volumes trends in our most profitable lines of business are encouraging, and we expect the positive momentum to improve as we see our normal seasonal upturn.
Our recycling operations resulted in a $0.02 decline in earnings per share compared to the first quarter of 2014. This decline is due to the more than 14% drop in average commodity prices for the quarter and an 8% decline in volumes associated with the slowdown in Western U.S. ports and contractual losses as we renegotiate contracts to include improved processing fee and rebate structures.
On a positive note, we've seen our operating costs improve as we tighten our enforcement on contaminated loads, and our capacity utilization is at the highest level that we've seen. However, the operational improvements have not been enough to offset the decline in commodity prices, so we will continue to look to improve operations and rationalize our recycling assets until we see the market improve.
Given the continued weakness in overall recycling commodity prices and lower volumes, the full-year impact from our recycling business is now anticipated to be closer to negative $0.10 per share when compared to 2014 versus our original outlook of between negative $0.03 and negative $0.05 per share. We also expect foreign currency translation to continue to be about a $0.01 per share headwind per quarter for the remainder of the year.
So 2015 is off to a strong start, and we have the momentum to achieve our full-year goals of adjusted EPS of between $2.48 and $2.55 per share despite lower-than-expected recycling results and foreign currency translation headwinds. We also expect to achieve our full year free cash flow guidance of between $1.4 billion and $1.5 billion.
As we move through the second quarter and see the seasonal upturn, we expect to see continued improvement in our volumes. Combined with our focus on cost and pricing, this should lead to continued growth in earnings and free cash flow.
I'll now turn the call over to Jim to discuss our first quarter results in more detail.
James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
Thanks, David. During the first quarter of 2015, we decided to refinance a significant portion of our high coupon senior notes. As a result of the combination of a make-whole redemption and a cash tender offer to purchase certain senior notes, the issuance of $1.8 billion of new senior notes, we reduced the weighted average interest rate of our portfolio by 100 basis points, extended the weighted average duration of these debt obligations by three years, and reduced senior note debt by $181 million. The after-tax charge for the early extinguishment of debt related to these financing transactions was $344 million.
We also had two balance sheet items in the quarter. We had a true-up of the sale of our Wheelabrator subsidiary, which reduced our gain on sale, and we impaired a short-lived landfill asset. Those two items negatively affected earnings by $0.03 per share but had no effect on free cash flow.
In the first quarter of 2015, our focus on reducing SG&A cost continues to bear fruit. Overall, SG&A cost declined $27 million compared to the first quarter of 2014. When you adjust 2014 for the operations that we divested, our year-over-year SG&A cost improvement was $15 million, consistent with our expectations for savings from our reorganization. With the strong results in the first quarter, we expect to achieve our full-year SG&A goals of reducing SG&A cost by $60 million.
Turning to cash flow for the first quarter, free cash flow was $285 million in the first quarter of 2015, an improvement of $22 million when compared to the first quarter of 2014, excluding the $221 million of free cash flow related to operations divested in 2014.
Our capital expenditures for the quarter were $233 million, $33 million less than the first quarter of 2014. However, we spent about the same about of capital as a percentage of revenue in both years. Given the strong start to the year, we still expect capital expenditures of approximately $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion. And free cash flow in 2015 is expected to be between $1.4 billion and $1.5 billion.
First quarter revenues were $3 billion. In addition to the $220 million impact from the divestitures and a $25 million impact from foreign currency fluctuations, the lower fuel surcharge negatively affected revenues by $36 million.
Looking at internal revenue growth for the first quarter, our collection and disposal core price was 4.4%, with volumes declining 1.2%. This led to total company income from operations growing $21 million, operating income margin expanding 130 basis points, operating EBITDA growing $11 million, and operating EBITDA margin growing 140 basis points.
Our collection lines of business continue to see the benefit of the price/volume tradeoff. Our commercial core price was 6.6%. Our industrial core price was 9.4% and residential achieved 2.1% core price.
In addition to the continued strong momentum on pricing, we saw some positive momentum in volume. Commercial volumes were down 2.8% in the first quarter of 2015 versus a decline of 4.8% in 2014, a 200 basis point improvement and the best result in the past seven quarters.
Industrial volumes improved 520 basis points from a negative 5.7% in the first quarter of 2014 to a negative 0.5% in 2015. In April, we see industrial volumes turning positive for the first time since the first quarter of 2013. Residential volumes declined 3.1% in the first quarter 2015 versus a decline of 3.5% in 2014, but those losses were generally intentional as we pushed price over volume in our residential line.
Overall, collection core price was 5.7%, with volumes declining 2.3%. The volume change was a 220-basis-point improvement from the first quarter of 2014. This core price and volume led to income from operations growing almost $14 million and margin expanding 140 basis points.
In the landfill line of business, we saw the benefits of both positive volume and positive core price in the first quarter. We saw same-store average MSW rates increase year-over-year for the eighth consecutive quarter, up 1.2% from Q1 2014. Combined special waste and revenue-generating cover volumes were a positive 2.3%. MSW volumes grew by 5.7%, and C&D volume grew 10.9%.
Total landfill volume increased 1.8%. This led to income from operations growing $2.5 million, which is the eighth consecutive quarter of growth, and margins grew 40 basis points. We believe that weather had some impact on landfill volumes, but the special waste pipeline looks strong, so we expect to see positive landfill volumes all year.
Looking at our recycling line of business, we had some challenges with low commodity prices and declining volumes. The impact from our recycling business was a negative $0.02 per share in the first quarter when compared to the first quarter of 2014. That decline would have been more than $0.05 per share if we'd not been taking steps to improve contracts and reduce operating costs. Those steps included auditing inbound material to ensure compliance, renegotiating contracts to recover the appropriate amount of processing costs and improving the quality of materials coming into our plants through consumer education.
We were also able to improve the overall operating efficiency of our plants. As David mentioned, we expect our recycling operations are going to be a headwind all year, but we're seeing the results of our efforts to improve the operations.
When commodity prices rebound, we're in a great position to see meaningful earnings improvements. In the meantime, we will curtail capital spending in our recycling operations which will allow us to allocate more of our $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion of capital spend to our core solid waste assets.
Moving to operating expenses, we continue to see improvement in all of our cost lines. With respect to total operating costs, operating cost as a percent of revenue improved 130 basis points to 64% and improved $131 million in the first quarter after adjusting for divestitures. $83 million of the improvement related to lower diesel costs and lower recycling commodity rebates to our customers.
We are also seeing the continued benefits from our service delivery optimization program and our labor costs as we see improved efficiency in all of our collection lines of business. Labor and related benefits improved $17 million when compared to the first quarter of 2014. The remaining savings were primarily driven by improvements in subcontractor costs.
Finally, looking at our other financial metrics, at the end of the first quarter, our debt-to-total capital ratio was 62.3%. Our expected 2015 weighted average cost of debt is 4.3% and the floating rate portion of our total debt portfolio was 9% at the end of the quarter.
In the first quarter, we returned $176 million to our shareholders through our dividend. As David mentioned, we expect to return more cash to our shareholders in the second quarter as we look to repurchase shares to offset dilution.
Our income tax rate in the first quarter was 41%. Adjusted for items excluded in our as-adjusted results, the tax rate was 34.2% which is closely in line with our expected tax rate of approximately 35% for the full year.
To summarize our quarter, with the exception of recycled commodity prices, virtually all of our financial and operating metrics are tracking ahead of our internal expectations and our previous guidance. We expect that to continue throughout 2015.
I want to thank all of our employees for their hard work in the first quarter. I know that they will continue their focus to make 2015 a successful year. And with that, Janisha, let's open the line for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Your first question comes from the line of Corey Greendale of First Analysis.
Corey Greendale - First Analysis Securities Corp.
Hey. Good morning.
David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Good morning, Corey.
James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
Corey.
Corey Greendale - First Analysis Securities Corp.
So, first, I apologize, this is a little bit of a mechanical question, but in the press release, the internal growth numbers that you're giving, are those adjusted for â are you pulling out divestitures in the denominator from the year prior period?
James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
Yeah, we are pulling out divestitures. Yeah.
David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yes.
Corey Greendale - First Analysis Securities Corp.
Okay. So, in other words, if you pull out divestitures, volume was down 3% just based on the operations that you still have?
James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
That's correct.
David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
That's correct. Yeah.
Corey Greendale - First Analysis Securities Corp.
Okay. Good. Thank you. I'm getting a slightly different number. I'm not sure why. But anyway, so my question is it sounds like the core business is kind of moving in the right direction. So could you just talk about a little bit more detail on the pieces that â where the volume is declining, like national accounts. Is that â are you seeing more aggression there? Do you think you're hitting the ceiling on what you can do in terms of pricing?
David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yeah. Basically, Corey, that's the carryover of our largest national account that we lost last year and then two residential franchise contracts that we lost in our Southern Group last year. And as you can imagine, all of those contracts were single-digit margin and not revenue that we wanted to keep without significant price increases. So, that was business that we pretty much intentionally shed.
Corey Greendale - First Analysis Securities Corp.
And the volume decline didn't accelerate Q4, correct?
David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Pardon?
Corey Greendale - First Analysis Securities Corp.
The volume was not down as significantly in Q4 as it was in Q1 of 2015. Is that correct?
David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Well, Corey, when we look at it, we look at the specific lines of business. When you look at the commercial and industrial line, they were actually improved from the fourth quarter. On the commercial line, we were down 3.5% in the fourth quarter. We were only down 2.8% in the first. On industrial, we were down 0.9% the fourth quarter. We were only down 0.5% in the first quarter.
And that's â really, that what's you've got going on in our business. What we're trying to say both in the scripts and in the press release is that we're seeing improving volumes in our most profitable lines of business. We're seeing declining volumes in our less profitable lines of business like recycling and residential. But even in residential, you can see it getting a little bit better year-over-year by 40 basis points and it only went backwards 20 basis points from the fourth quarter to the first quarter.
Corey Greendale - First Analysis Securities Corp.
Okay. What I'm trying to get a sense of is just given the â what seems to be the improving environment overall. And David, I understand things are moving in the right direction on the commercial/industrial. So, the piece like residential, for example, is it getting more competitive for some reason than it has been over the past year?
David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yeah. No, I wouldn't say it's getting more competitive. I think residential has always been a very competitive line of business. Look, those are big contracts, big slugs of revenue, and generally, you've got a lot of different bidders. So, there's always been aggressive players on the residential side. Frankly, I would say that we're seeing a little bit of more stability on the residential side, as folks that have taken those low-margin contracts from us over the last few years start to realize they can't make a lot of money on them.
James E. Trevathan - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President
Especially, Dave, when you look at the capital that's necessary to fund those new contracts, people are starting to look at it a little more diligently than we think in the past.
James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
Corey, just to give you a sense of â you asked about the volume in Q4 versus Q1 and you also asked about kind of the difference between 1.2% which is our traditional solid waste volume loss and 3%. To answer the second one first, the difference between the 1.2% and the 3%, 0.8% of that is commodities, 0.2% is renewable energy, and then you got another 0.2% which is oil and gas, and then you got 0.6% which is national accounts. That 0.6% is $21 million and $18 million of that is Wal-Mart. So to go from the 1.2% to the 3%, it's largely commodities, national accounts, and energy services or oil and gas.
When you go from Q4 to negative 0.8% on volume to that negative 3%, it doesn't look dramatically different. In fact, collections actually up, as David mentioned, collection was up 0.2% but then you've got energy services that was down 0.5% of that delta. You have renewable energy that was down 0.4%. You have oil and gas that was down 0.4% and recycling down 0.4%. And then the other one that is â that changes from Q4 to Q1 is the landfills were down a bit versus Q4, and the reason for that is really special waste was a little softer than we thought, probably largely because the weather in Q1 was quite a bit different than the weather in Q4.
Corey Greendale - First Analysis Securities Corp.
Yeah. Actually, that's really helpful, Jim. And one other quick one, then I'll turn it over. Do you have an estimate of what the year-over-year impact â I'm assuming it was some benefit â was from lower fuel costs net of the lower surcharges?
David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yeah. That was about $0.02 in the quarter. But from our perspective, you get lower fuel because you get the recovery from the fuel surcharge, but we also have some oil and gas assets that we maintain. And so when you look at the overall effect, it was about flat.
Corey Greendale - First Analysis Securities Corp.
Okay. I appreciate it. Thanks.
David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yeah.

Your next question comes from the line of Alex Ovshey of Goldman Sachs.
Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Great. Thank you. Good morning, everyone.
James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
Hey, Alex.
David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Good morning.
Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs & Co.
A couple questions for you, guys. First, thinking about the impact of the CPI on pricing. Do you expect the impact from CPI to change pricing as we move through the balance of 2015?
David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
No. I don't think that we'll see a significant change in CPI. But when we look at our pricing programs, we try to look at them holistically, and if CPI is lower, then we just have to get those dollars from somewhere else. And so if we get a bump from CPI, that would be great. But if we don't get that bump, we're just going to have to pull those dollars from somewhere else, and that's what we've been doing the last few years, and that's what we'll do this year.
Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Got it. Thanks, David. And then in the recycling business, I'm not sure if you mentioned this, but is there any EBITDA in that business right now?
James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
Right now it's...
David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Well, there's EBITDA because the depreciation. There's not a lot of EBIT
James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
Well, there's EBITDA. There's not much EBIT, yes. The impact of EBIT, income from operations was about negative $11 million year-over-year, Alex.
Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Okay. Okay. Got it. Got it. And then, just lastly, is there any visibility on potentially seeing a benefit from coal ash volumes, either towards the end of this year into 2016?
David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yeah. We've got a nice contract that actually begins in the second half of the year. It's not going to be â it's not going to move the needle significantly, but it's a nice contract, a few million dollars. But we're having continuing discussions with all the various utilities and I'd expect that to be a nice volume stream for the next â gosh, for the next 5 years to 10 years.
Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs & Co.
Appreciate the color. I'll turn it over.
David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Certainly.

Your next question comes from the line of Scott Levine of Imperial Capital.
Scott J. Levine - Imperial Capital LLC
Hey. Good morning, guys.
David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Good morning.
Scott J. Levine - Imperial Capital LLC
So I just want to focus on â I think, Jim, you mentioned a 60-basis-point volume headwind from national accounts and Wal-Mart. To be clear, is that all associated with contract changes within the past 12 months? Were there any additional changes this quarter and then maybe a little bit more elaboration on your thoughts on that business in general going forward?
James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
So, I'll take that and then maybe, Jim, you can add to that.
James E. Trevathan - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President
Sure.
James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
Yeah. So, for the quarter â and we expect â well, the Wal-Mart, that will anniversary in May, so we won't see that headwind, if you want to call it that. It's a headwind on the revenue line. It's not a headwind on the bottom line. But that will anniversary in May.
We did lose some other contracts and some of them were intentional. Some of them were not intentional. We lost some due to aggressive pricing and it's a competitive marketplace for sure.
James E. Trevathan - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President
Jim, what I would just add to that is that we are also winning new contracts. We have won some business, some additional business from current customers, as well as some additional businesses that you'll see in future quarters. But that roll-forward effect from some of those large losses like Wal-Mart will continue through at least the first half of the year.
David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
And when we look at that business from a philosophical point of view, look, we completely understand that sort of like the residential business, there's some stiff competition there. But particularly, where we can get that front-end small-container work that we can tuck right into our operations and create that route density, that's really the kind of work that we want to pick up. The compactor work like the Wal-Mart business is generally lower margin and it doesn't really help us from a route density point of view. And so, our focus will be on that small-container business but we're obviously going to remain competitive in national accounts and we'd expect to continue to be the biggest player.
Scott J. Levine - Imperial Capital LLC
Got it. And just to be clear and strictly for modeling purposes, was Mal-Wart half of that 60 basis point volume impact or less than that or is it â just to make sure we model the volumes right for the rest of the year.
James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
I think it was a little more than half, Scott.
Scott J. Levine - Imperial Capital LLC
A little more than half. Got it. And then as my follow-up, I think you mentioned plans to repurchase stock to offset dilution, share dilution in the second quarter, just kind of are you still holding off on, call it the larger repurchase activity as you assess M&A prospects and maybe a little bit more elaboration on your thoughts on the acquisition landscape?
David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yeah. No, that's exactly right. So, when we look at 2015, there's really two pieces to it. There's what I'd call sort of our normal recurring stock buyback. We generate a lot of free cash flow. A good portion of that goes back to our shareholders through the dividend and traditionally the remainder goes back to our shareholders through a share repurchase and some of it goes into small tuck-in acquisitions. In 2015 we're getting back to that and so what we're talking about doing in the second quarter, I would characterize as part of our sort of normal, recurring returning of cash to our shareholders.
On the redeployment of the Wheelabrator proceeds, as we talk to sellers, it's sort of interesting. You've got really two things happening. You've got expectations of price multiples which are probably a little higher than we expected, but then you've also got some timing events, right? You've got private sellers that might have family or estate issues. And then you've got private equity sellers that might have funds that they want to hold for a number of years that have sort of a liquidation timeframe on them. And so what we're battling is price expectations and timing expectations.
My guess is that, by midyear, we will know whether we can meet both timing and price expectations. If we can't do that, then we'll buy back stock. Now, that doesn't mean that we're not going to ultimately talk with those sellers and buy their business. If they have timing expectations that don't mature for a year or 18 months, we'll be talking to them in a year or 18 months, and we'll buy them as part of our normal acquisition process.
And so, in the middle of the year, by sort of the end of the second quarter, we would expect to be in a position where we're going to make a call where we say, we will either buy those businesses with the proceeds or we'll buy back stock with the proceeds. And if we don't buy those businesses with the proceeds, you'll probably see us continue to look to buy them over the next couple years as their timing gets better.
Scott J. Levine - Imperial Capital LLC
Got it. Thanks, David.
David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Certainly.

Your next question comes from the line of Joe Box of KeyBanc Capital Markets.
Joe G. Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.
Hey. Good morning, guys.
James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
Good morning.
David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Good morning, Joe.
Joe G. Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.
So, just a clarification on volume. Are we still thinking about volumes turning the corner later in the year and either flattening out on a total basis or even being up?
David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yeah. So, let's sort of look at those profitable components that we talked about before. On industrial, we actually saw volumes turn positive in April. They were only negative 0.5% in the quarter, and we actually saw them turn positive in April. So, I would expect that we would see positive volumes from the industrial side going forward.
The landfill side has always been positive volume, but we would expect to see that get better as we get to the seasonal upturn. We had a little bit of a weather effect in the first quarter. So we'd expect to see those volumes improve.
On the commercial side, again, we're 200 basis points better than we were in the first quarter of last year. We're 70 basis points better than we were in the fourth quarter. We would expect that sort of rate of improvement to continue, such that by the end of the year, I would expect that we'll be closer to flat on the commercial side. So, if you look at commercial being closer to flat, industrial and landfill being positive, I think that could lead to positive volumes by the end of the year in those three lines of business.
Now, the headwinds you have are basically national accounts and the residential line of business. Those will be slight drags, but again, those are low-margin drags, so we're willing to live with those. So, when we look at the core solid waste business, the negative 1.2% that we had in the first quarter, we completely believe that by the end of the year, those will be flat to positive such that our guidance for the year of negative 0.5% to flat volumes is still valid.
James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
Joe, when you think about how that volume that you talk about translates to top-line revenue, the way we looked at the quarter was when we looked at collection, disposal and transfer, the revenue was up fairly decently at about $25 million. And keep in mind, that's almost all organic. We really didn't have a lot in the way of acquisitions for the last 12 months, so up $25 million.
The second factor, of course, was, as we've talked a lot about this morning, the negative revenue impact of recycle commodity prices and recycle volumes. And that was a negative $70 million. So â and then of course, the third factor, David just mentioned, fuel surcharge, FX, and we've talked about the lower â the lost Walmart contract and some of the lost national accounts business.
But overall, the volume numbers that we â the improvement that we're seeing in some of those volume numbers on the core side is translating to top-line revenue. We weren't displeased with the $25 million in those three core businesses.
Joe G. Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.
Well, actually, Jim, so to that point, maybe you can help me understand the disconnect here, if I just add up the numbers that I have for collection, disposal and transfer, acknowledging that there is some component that's going to go into intercompany, if I'm just adding it up, I'm coming up with a flat number versus last year. So are you stripping out FX to get to that $25 million? Are you stripping out fuel? What am I missing?
David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
No, you're adding in price. When you look at it from a total revenue point of view, you've got to add the price in and as well as the volume component.
Joe G. Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.
I'm just looking at total revenues and a flat year-over-year.
James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
FX is not included in that $25 million. So I've broken it into a couple of different buckets which was our core solid waste, collection, disposal, transfer. Those, price and volume, excluding divestitures, was up $25 million...
Joe G. Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.
Okay.
James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
...in revenue. And then the second factor was a negative $70 million in recycling. And the third factor was $36 million negative in fuel surcharge, $25 million negative in FX and $21 million negative in national accounts.
Joe G. Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.
Okay. Great. Thanks for the clarification. So I'm just looking at the core solid waste business, and I'm curious, what are you specifically seeing that gives you the confidence that you can offset that incremental $0.05 to $0.07 headwind in recycling? Or is that just a moot point because you guys would prefer to address the guidance in 2Q?
David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
No. I mean, look, we see â what I would tell you is that we're much more confident now that we're going to get the dollars that we expect to get from our pricing program. We continue to see good improvement on the cost side, both on the SG&A and on the operating cost side. And then, I'd say that we're probably a little more optimistic than we were at the beginning of the year from a volume perspective.
Again, that's why this is a â it's an interesting quarter for us. When we first looked at the quarter and saw the revenue decline, we said, wow, what's going on? When we looked behind it, we say, we see some really good trends in our profitable lines of business. We can't help the fact that we're going to lose $70 million of revenue on the recycling side because of commodity prices, but when we look at our very profitable commercial, industrial landfill lines, we see some really positive trends there.
And so â and that was â all those positive trends occurred even though we had some negative weather in the first quarter. So I would say that we're fairly bullish on the volume side. We're extremely confident on the price side and we think we'll get a little bit more out of our cost programs than we expected at the beginning of the year.
Joe G. Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.
Got it. Thanks. One last one for me then. So why does recycling actually get worse as we move through the year sequentially? I mean, it seems like pricing is somewhat bottomed and comps should get easier, so why would the headwind actually get worse?
David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yeah. Well, the price actually â I'm not sure if the price is bottomed or not. It's as low as it's ever been, but we haven't seen any indication of a bottom. And so you've got some fairly tough comps in the second and third quarter, gets a little bit better in the fourth quarter.
And then you've got the volume decline, right, the 8% volume decline. We don't expect to see that improve throughout the course of the year. And so, basically, it's mostly driven by commodity pricing, and I would tell you that we're being a little bit conservative on that because we just don't see any catalyst out there that's going to drive the commodity prices up significantly.
James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
Joe, I think what you're probably thinking is why can't you just straight-line the $0.02 and come to $0.08. And the reason is that commodity prices dropped throughout the quarter. So we're looking at kind of straight lining from the commodity price in March, which was the lowest of the three months.
Joe G. Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.
Got it.
David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yeah. For the quarter, it was down 14%. For the month, it was down 24%. So, we're basically extrapolating that low price across the rest of the year.
Joe G. Box - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.
Okay. That clarification helps. Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Al Kaschalk of Wedbush Securities.
Al Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities, Inc.
Good morning.
David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Good morning, Al.
James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
Good morning, Al.
Al Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities, Inc.
I want to continue on recycling. Can you help us maybe appreciate, for lack of better word, the mix issue that you're dealing with, and then secondly, the contract structure issue that is probably a multi-year resolution to at the end of the day conclude that this macro theme that you set up for 20 million tons to handle recycled product still makes sense in the shareholders' mind?
James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
Yes. So, Al, a couple of things on the â first of all on the contracts and the mix issue. Each of these contracts has an expectation as to mix of commodities, and when that mix changes, we have to address that with the customer. So, for example, we've talked quite a bit about glass over the last couple of quarters. Glass is heavy, so the customers may like it. We don't like it as much. It's the only commodity that we don't get paid for on the back end, and we actually have to pay to get rid of it. And so as glass goes up, as an example, then we have to address that with a customer if there are limitations, mix limitations, within their contract.
Similarly, if there are contamination level restrictions. So, for example, if a community has a restriction of 10% contamination levels, and when we go through an audit and find that there are 20%, then we have to recover some of that. So part of what we're doing through our recycling team is really taking a tough stance on holding customers to contracts on contamination levels and material mix.
David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Jim, I would that those two issues are absolutely related because some of the mix issues that are caused as cities and counties want to divert more waste, add to the contamination level in some of those commodities, and many of our older contracts don't allow us to charge. That's what we're changing. We're going in, some of them in mid-contract and having some success. Most of them, though, we'll wait until the contract ends until we can change the terms that allow us to get paid for their mix issue or their contamination issue.
Al Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities, Inc.
So, clearly, a multi-year undertaking here?
David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yeah. Look, there's two pieces to it. There is fixing the mix and contract issue, then it's fixing operations, right? I mean, we still have some opportunities to consolidate plants, to drive out some operating costs. And we think we can make some more headway there.
Like Jim said, if it wasn't for the headway that we made in the first quarter, it would have been a â if you look just at the price component, it was a $0.05 problem. We still think we've got some operating costs that we can pull out. We're going to have to consolidate some plants and rationalize some assets.
And I think that's what customers need to realize is that we're not the only ones rationalizing assets. The industry is rationalizing assets. And unless we can work out a way where recycling is profitable over the long term, there's not going to be recycling. And customers certainly don't want to live with that. So, we just need to make sure that the customers understand that if they want glass recycled, we need to get paid for it. We actually lose or we lost in the quarter $6 million by recycling glass. Long term that cannot be sustainable for Waste Management. So, we need to work with the customers to get them to understand the mix issues, to understand the commodity markets so that we can make a long term viable business out of recycling.
Al Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities, Inc.
But the progress to-date, David, has been slim. Is that because the major customers or your larger customers in this area are not ready to discuss until contract comes up...?
David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yeah, exactly. Most of these contracts are long-term contracts and â look, it's a long-term contract; we signed the contract. We will live up to the contract. But what they need to realize is we'll live up to that contract, but we're not going to be there when the contract ends, and nobody's going to be there when the contract ends.
So, if they want us to maintain the facilities that we have in those markets, we're going to have to get some relief from these contracts or we're going to just have to shutter the plants. And so, I would hope that customers would say, let's take a long-term view at it rather than a short-term view. But as you know, as we generate $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion of free cash, there's not a lot of sympathy for our losses in recycling.
James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
Now, I wouldn't characterize the progress as slim. I think what's happened is it's been overshadowed by the real dramatic fall in commodity prices. Look, commodity prices were basically kind of â our average bucket of commodity prices was in the $100 range for the last two years, last two and a half years. $98 finished the year in 2014. And all of a sudden, it's gone from $98 to $82 and when we process between 6 million and 7 million tons a year, that's a big price decline to absorb. So, we've made some good progress on controlling cost and on kind of holding customers to contract but, man, with such a dramatic commodity price decline, it was hard to overcome it.
Al Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities, Inc.
So â but you're not able to maybe take a little more aggressive action yourself and walk away from these contracts?
James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
Well, we're looking at everything, but it's hard to walk away from a contract at times.
Al Kaschalk - Wedbush Securities, Inc.
Okay. I understand. The follow-up then, just a little bit more â David, your comments about capital deployment or redeployment of the Wheelabrator proceeds, it would seem to me that this is more a function of maybe some larger transactions that you're looking at than your traditional annual deals you're doing or even something of a Deffenbaugh size. Could you comment on that? And if that's not the case, then why wouldn't you be out in the market aggressively buying back stock particularly given today's reaction?
David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yeah, exactly. Well, obviously, that gives us more opportunity to buy back more stock. And so you're exactly right. I mean, what we're looking at when we look at the Wheelabrator proceeds are looking at â we sort of look at it the exact same way. We say we want another three Deffenbaughs, right?
And those are â there's not a lot of Deffenbaughs in the country. And once you find that type of business, you've got to overcome two hurdles. One, are they ready to sell? And two, what do they want? What's the price that they want to sell? And I would tell you that at the beginning of the year, we were pretty encouraged by what we saw on both of those fronts. As we've got into deeper discussions with sellers, we found out that some of them had bigger timing issues than we thought and some of them have higher pricing expectations than we thought.
And so â look, that doesn't mean that we ultimately won't buy those businesses, but it might mean that it's going to take us longer to buy those businesses, and if that's the case, then we do need to be out in the market buying back our stock because, look, as I said, that's the business we know the best. We're never going to pay a multiple higher than our own multiple because there's one business we know real well and that's ours. And so I would guess that in the back half of the year, we will be in the market more than just to cover dilution, but if we can get to the point where we can get some of the sellers that we can meet their timing and their pricing expectations, we would obviously much prefer to buy good core solid waste businesses at reasonable prices.

Hi. Good morning, gentlemen. Thanks for talking my call.
James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
Good morning.
Charles E. Redding - BB&T Capital Markets
On the industrial side, it certainly sounds like you're seeing improvement here. I guess as we look ahead, how do we rectify what looks to be slowing industrial production and a tough market for US exports with your expectation for stronger volume growth?
David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Well, it was mentioned earlier, you've got the coal ash coming, but you've also got a huge amount of construction being done along the chemical corridors, right, from Houston to Beaumont and up to Baton Rouge and up through Pennsylvania where you've got very low natural gas prices. You've got some huge projects being built. We expect to get good volumes out of that. And then when you look at the residential and commercial construction, those numbers look fairly strong.
So we think that the economy is going to be finally a little bit of a help to us on that side. Now, remember, we also have a lot of those hauls in our energy services. We really haven't seen a dramatic drop on the energy services side. And so we've got well positioned in still some good shale plays there. So we see pretty positive trends throughout the various sectors that drive industrial hauls for us
Charles E. Redding - BB&T Capital Markets
Okay. And then I guess just a little follow-up on Canada. I realize it's relatively fractional for you, but can you speak to perhaps what you're seeing there? And then I guess has the macro pullback had a material impact on the recent volume growth in the region?
James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
I think it's kind of the tale of kind of two parts of the country. Western Canada is, particularly Alberta, is suffering a bit from the energy price decline. Eastern Canada seems to be reasonably strong, similar to kind of Northeast US is.

Your next question comes from the line of Tyler Brown of Raymond James.
P. Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Hey. Good morning, guys.
David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Good morning.
James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
Good morning.
P. Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Hey. Just, Jim, can you help us out on the cadence of cash flow and just why Q1 was such a large working capital drag? I don't know if that was the cash taxes paid on Wheelabrator or if your cash conversion cycle creeped? And then maybe how do we think about the full-year impact of working capital in your cash from ops guidance?
James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
So, a couple of things running through working capital worth mentioning here. First of all, our â you may recall that in â for our bonus payout, our annual incentive comp payout that would have paid out in March of 2014, we accelerated a piece of that into December of 2013. So it was a 2013 year annual incentive comp, but it was â a portion of it was paid out in 2013. We did not do that this year.
So, we knew we were going to have a working capital negative headwind in March of this year, and that amounted to about $65 million. Most of that was that acceleration. A piece of it was just a higher payout from year 2014 versus year 2013. That was â totaled about $65 million as a headwind. We also had about $21 million in non-recurring, mostly non-recurring cash payout for the 2014 restructuring. We've got about $12 million left, and that will spread out over the next three quarters. But we had $21 million in Q1 that is for the most part non-recurring and that's a payout of our 2014 restructuring.
And then, in addition to that, we had â in 2014, we had a benefit, a $36 million benefit from the settlement of a forward-starting swap that didn't repeat, of course, this year. So, when you think about year-over-year, the negatives were those. The positive was EBITDA was up. And then the other positives were that we continue to make headway on managing working capital on DSO and DPO, particularly DPO was up 2.1 days, DSO up 0.6 days. So, we're starting to narrow the gap pretty significantly there from a couple of years ago.
P. Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Okay. So, is working capital a drag in cash from ops guidance or is it neutral?
James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
Well, I think working capital is certainly a drag in Q1. There will be some positives coming up as we look at the remainder of the year. So, for example, the San Jacinto settlement of last year, that won't repeat. And so that will be a tailwind for us on working capital.
And as I mentioned, we shouldn't have those â that cash impact from the restructuring starts to taper off pretty dramatically in Q2. And of course, the bonus headwind from the incentive comp payouts, and the acceleration of that, that doesn't recur either.
P. Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Okay. That's helpful. And then follow-up here. I just want to understand CapEx just a little bit better. So, if I look at trailing 12 months CapEx, and if I even adjust for divestitures, you guys are about 8.5% of sales. I think there's a common convention or belief out there that you need to be north of, call it, 9% of sales on a pure maintenance basis. So, am I missing something there, or how do you bridge the gap, the differential in the CapEx?
James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
We've said that â we kind of gave a number of 8.3% to 9%. I think we gave that last year. First quarter is historically slow. We were â the number I had was 7.7% of revenue in the first quarter, and â but if I look at Q1 of 2014, it was 7.8%. If I look at Q1 of 2013, it was 7.9%. So not way out of range with those two years' first quarters.
We expect that 2015 actually is going to be in that $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion range, which is a bit of a headwind for us in terms of free cash flow because, last year, we only spent $1.15 billion. So we're going to spend somewhere between $50 million and $150 million more in CapEx. And, clearly, on a percent of revenue, without the Wheelabrator assets, that will be a higher percentage of revenue. So, I think 2015, not only is it going to be higher in absolute dollars, it's going to be higher as a percent of revenue.
P. Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Okay. That's helpful. And then just maybe if I can squeeze one last in here, thinking about capital structure. But you guys have kind of swept some of the Wheelabrator proceeds, the net proceeds, I should say, maybe to Deffenbaugh. You had your note repayment. Maybe you've de-levered a little bit. But I've got you at about, call it, 2.7 on the leverage. You got $300 million in cash. So when we think about future capital deployment, is the idea that you would re-lever to do so? And if so, what is kind of the level of leverage you're willing to go to, or what's your kind of optimal capital structure?
James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
Yes. So if I think of us as being in kind of that 2.78 leverage ratio range, yeah, I would expect that to increase slightly as we acquire some businesses to replace Wheelabrator going forward.
P. Tyler Brown - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.
Okay. Perfect. Thanks.

Your final question comes from the line of Michael Hoffman of Stifel.
Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
Thank you for taking my questions. So cold or allergies, David?
David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Allergies for me.
Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
Poor thing. Jim, can we do a little bit of a waterfall to try and reconcile 2014 EPS and the guidance for 2015? If I understand everything you've given us, and thanks for the data, I should take $0.18 out of last year's number for all the divestments and then I need to take $0.10 out for recycling and $0.04 for currency and that kind of gives me a starting place, add in buybacks and then I get growth. That's the kind of how to â is that the right way to think about it?
James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
Yeah. And there's some interest expense savings in there, too.
Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
Interest expense would be a part of that. Okay. So getting back to the growth, then, aspect of this and then the solid waste side, and you may have given this data and I pardon, you were just â there was so much of it I'm not sure I got it all written down. But weight per yard trends in your front-end loader business had exited 2014 on a positive trend line. What's that trend line coming through the first half of the year at this point? And where does it sort of set in your mind about that cycle of service interval upgrades that create such operating leverage?
David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yeah, Michael, when we look at the commercial line of business, I'll give you a few reasons why we're optimistic. First is you're right. The weights continued through the first quarter, we saw improvement there. We saw service increases exceed service decreases, so there's some good news there.
But frankly, the best news that I've seen on the commercial line of business, we just went through reviews with our 17 market areas, and 12 of our 17 market areas had net positive new business in the first quarter. The other good part of that news is that over two-thirds of that new business was greenfield projects, new businesses that are created, not stealing share from somebody else. And so I think what you're seeing is a better secular trend, and what you're seeing is that we're taking advantage of that better secular trend.
Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
Okay. So following through with that then, on your C&D side of the business, on the pulls, what's the trend in absolute number of pulls and then revenue per pull, how's that trend look like?
David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yeah. The revenue per pull is nicely improving. On the number of pulls, frankly, I don't have the actual number of pulls. I know what the percentage increase was. But you saw 10.9% volume in the landfill, and so I would assume that equates to a pretty healthy increase in the number of pulls.
James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
I think it was down slightly in terms of revenue pulls which pretty much correlates to the volume number that we talked about, but it was down slightly, and part of that, as David mentioned early in the call, Michael, was in energy services. I mean you're down 50% in rigs. Fortunately, we were able to replace some of that revenue, so we're not down as much as the rig count, of course, but it did affect the hauling side of the business.
Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
Okay. So what I was really trying to get at too is, and you alluded to this to one other question, if I remember correctly, pretty much the whole industry assumed going into this year that residential construction would hold at about 1 million starts. Somebody was looking for it to be better, but so far, the data set would suggest that maybe that trend is better, one.
And two, the non-residential construction ex oil and gas and energy broadly, if you will, power and oil and gas, which had been a positive into 2014. All of the other components, commercial, lodging, office and what have you, actually just struck a bottom in 2014 and started to turn a corner. Are you seeing that corner turn in both...?
David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yeah. I mean, look, I think that's exactly right, Michael. I mean, look, we're not going to call a dramatic turn, but I do think that we, for the first time in two years, we're willing to say that there is a good secular trend going on that we see continuing.
Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
Okay. All right. And then on the recycling side, if $98 was the number for blended commodities in December and $82 is 1Q, what's the blended commodity dollar number given the current cost structure of recycling business to be breakeven on an EBIT basis? What do you need that to be?
David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Breakeven is probably in the $78 to $80 range.
Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
Okay. And then, on free cash flow, when do I see working through the cash flow from ops? There's $200 million in non-recurring tax situation. When do I see that walk its way through? Is that spread out through the whole year or there's a tax filing in, I think, 2Q and 4Q? Is it a 2Q and 4Q issue?
James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
Yes. Well, we pay in all three quarters. We kind of make a double payment in Q2 and Q4. So, you'll start to see it in Q2 and it will carry through the rest of the year.
Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
Okay. So I should see a little bit of above average cash flow from ops as a percent of revenues in 2Q?
James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
Yeah.
Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
Okay.
James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
I mean none of that $210 million, Michael, showed up because we didn't make any federal tax payments in Q1.
Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
Right. So, stripping that away and looking at the sort of recurring number, 1.2% to 1.3%, what do you think, based on what you're looking at the business today, the embedded recurring growth rate of that 1.2% to 1.3% would be as I look forward? Is that mid-single digits, high-single...?
David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
I think you're looking at basically sort of that 5% to 7% compounded growth rate.
Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
Okay. That's very helpful. And then two housekeeping questions just because I'm a little confused. On page 6 of your 8-K, you have a nice table...
David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Michael, that's a little bit obtuse for us.
Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
What's that, page 6 of the 8-K?
David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Going to a specific page of the 10-K...
Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
Right. Sorry. But you have these great tables you've given, and you talk about landfill volume up, but the tons number you have in the document actually has it down versus a year ago. You were 21.3 a year ago, and you're 20.9. So, I'm trying to reconcile the script and the data that's in the document.
James E. Trevathan - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President
Hey, Michael. That's all intercompany volume based. Our intercompany volume is down. Third-party volumes are up. That's the difference.
Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
Perfect. That's great. And then as I think about the fuel, I mean, I had more cost saves than I did revs in 1Q, but I would assume that that gap narrows through the rest of the year, and it's less of â it's more of just a net offset to each other as I work through the year. That's a timing difference of the surcharge comes back slower than the savings hit?
James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
Yeah, that's correct.
Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
Okay. And I should try and just smooth that out through the remainder of the year and it kind of nets itself out by the end of the year?
James C. Fish - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President
Correct.
Michael E. Hoffman - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.
Okay. That's all I needed. Thanks.

David P. Steiner - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Thank you. Well, obviously, we at Waste Management had a very good quarter. But when we look beyond Waste Management and look at the overall industry, as we said with Michael, we see improving industry fundamentals, with the pricing environment stable and the volume environment improving. So we look forward to capitalizing on those improving industry fundamentals and continuing to gain momentum throughout 2015 and into 2016. And with that, we'll see you next quarter. Thank you.
