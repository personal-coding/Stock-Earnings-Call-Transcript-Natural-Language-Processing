Meg Whitman
Thank you, Jim. And thanks to all of you for joining us today. With the first quarter of fiscal 2015 now behind us, I would say that overall weâre on track with our turnaround and executing well on our separation. In Q1, we delivered solid performance in our business operations. We achieved non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.92, which was at the high end of our outlook range.
We continue to improve profitability, growing operating profit margins across all our major business segments. We increased investment and innovation to drive the future of both Hewlett-Packard Enterprise and HP Inc. And we executed well across key areas of our portfolio including industry standard servers, Converged Storage, private and managed cloud, personal systems and graphics. While we have more work to do to improve performance in other parts of the business, weâre about where we expected to be at this point in our turnaround journey.
Now there are couple of factors that had an impact on our first quarter financial results and how we think about the rest of the year, and I want to address these. Let me talk for a moment about the global environment with the particular focus on unfavorable currency movements. And I also want to address cash flow.
Weâre all aware that the global environment and currency movements have been a challenge for US-based companies. For HP the challenge is particularly acute with 65% of our revenue coming from outside the United States and over half of that from EMEA. This all impacts HP in multiple ways, the strength of the US dollar negatively impacted our reported revenue. Our revenue declined approximately 5% year-over-year as reported, but only 2% in constant currency. In addition, the recent currency movements had disrupted the competitive pricing landscape and impacted customer demand.
Aggressive pricing from our Japanese competitors in the printing business given the weakness of the yen was a continued challenge. We were able to manage these impacts in the quarter and deliver earnings as expected. But given the specific hedges we had in place and the significant currency movement that took place in January, we anticipate the impact on the remainder of FYâ15 will be greater than what we saw in Q1.
Weâre working hard to offset these impacts through repricing and productivity, but let me be very clear, fully mitigating currency movements of this size would require reducing investments in areas like innovation, key systems and tools and placement of printer units that simply would not be the right thing to do.
When we discussed the impact of currency on revenue in November, we estimated our headwind for fiscal 2015 to be approximately two points year-over-year. We now expect that headwind to be approximately 6 points assuming todayâs rate. That difference equates to approximately $3.3 billion in revenue, $1.5 billion in operating profit or $0.60 in earnings per share.
We believe we will be able to manage half of that through repricing and cost actions, but estimate a negative earnings impact of approximately $0.30 per share entirely due to currency. While we have taken down our full year earnings outlook, we remain on track to deliver flat revenue year-over-year in constant currency. Cathie will share more details on how we managed currency movements across the portfolio.
Now turning to cash flow. Q1 results were below our expectations impacted primarily by an increase in our cash conversion cycle and by timing issues. The cash conversion cycle was higher than expected as a result of higher day sales outstanding. Also we made restructuring payments earlier in the year than we expected and outperformed on HP Financial Service volume which negatively impacted cash year-on-year.
However, except for the currency impact and separation payments we would have expected cash flow for the full year to be in line with our original outlook of $6.5 billion to $7 billion. Cathie will have more to say about this in a moment.
Now letâs talk about business performance and innovation. And as I said at the beginning of the call, we continue to make progress in our operating performance. In personal systems, the team is executing well. We out grew the market and gained share across all regions. We saw particular strength in notebooks where we regained our number one share position worldwide.
Commercial remains a key focus for us and at Discover in December we announced the industryâs thinnest and lightest business class notebook enabling our customers to be more productive in more places.
In printing, profitability remained strong, but we continue to face top-line challenges. Hardware and supplies revenue declined and going forward, we are going to be more aggressive in placing units to support long-term supplies growth. Iâm looking forward to some of the exciting new products Dion and his team are planning to launch in the coming months.
The enterprise group performed well with 9% growth in constant currency and industry standard servers led by strong Gen9 adoption and improved sales execution. HPâs end-to-end compute strategy led by the Gen9 portfolio as redefined the broader server industry and improvements in sales execution are paying off.
We also saw improved performance in business critical systems and our new products are gaining traction with customers. During the quarter, we expanded our server portfolio with HP Integrity Superdome X and HP Integrity NonStop X. These platforms run our customers most demanding mission critical workloads on x86 architectures with higher levels of performance, scalability, availability and efficiency.
In storage, we returned to growth in constant currency and we anticipate a fourth quarter of external disc market share expansion based on calendar Q4 results. We continue to see an industry shift to the mid-range, which is our sweet spot and at Discover we announced a refreshed portfolio of mid-range and flash optimized HP 3PAR StoreServ systems and itâs becoming clear around the industry that our HP Converged Storage portfolio is the best in the market. Just this month HP 3PAR StoreServ won the 2014 search storage product of the year gold award.
However, in networking results were disappointing after many quarters of growth. We had execution issues in the US and in China, which we are working to address. We made leadership changes in China in the quarter, which we believe will strengthen our ability to compete effectively in what remains a tough market. And in the US we are realigning sales incentives to increase focus.
We continue to bring new networking solutions to market, just last week we announced a new line of open network switches providing web scale customersâ choice, agility and scalability in their data center networks. Weâre focused on winning in this business and you will continue to see us make aggressive moves over the coming quarters.
Technology services were consistent with recent quarters with strong and predictable profitability. The team continued to execute well improving efficiency across the organization, while driving order growth in constant currency. We were pleased with the continued movement in newer portfolio offerings like proactive care and data center care.
In cloud, our HP Helion portfolio continues to gain traction worldwide, capturing market share in open hybrid cloud. During the quarter, we announced HP Helion wins with Alcatel-Lucent, Halfords, Telecom Italia and Symantec. And weâve seen strong pull through of HP products and services by new customers of HP Helion.
Last month HP Helion was recognized as a leader by Forrester Research and their inaugural Forrester Wave for private cloud in China are in the highest ranking for strategy. And early in the quarter, IDC recognized HP as a leader in US government private cloud.
In enterprise services revenue continued to be impacted by key account run off, softness in EMEA and currency headwinds. However, profitability improved year-over-year in line with our expectations and sales metrics are reflecting the go-to-market transformation underway in this business.
Among recent new logo wins, HP Enterprise services was selected by TNT, one of the worldâs largest express delivery companies to help future proof the business by consolidating and virtualizing its IT infrastructure and moving some functions to an HP Helion managed virtual private cloud environment.
And just today, we announced a major multi-billion dollar customer win with Deutsche Bank. With this partnership HP will help Deutsche Bank meet its long-term business objectives through a transformation of its IT infrastructure, including a customized HP Helion solution that will enable them to focus on creating and delivering new services for their clients. This was a hard thought win for HP and I am very pleased with the outcome.
In software we continue to shift our portfolio and operating model to SaaS and subscription based offerings. Customer consumption behavior and the need to adjust sales motions accordingly created a near term revenue headwind. Total revenue was down, however we saw grow in security and our recent acquisition of voltage security strengthens our portfolio in data encryption.
During the quarter, we also unveiled HP Haven on-demand, an important milestone in our big data strategy that gives organizations cloud-based access to key components of our Haven analytics platform. Overall we continue to see strength across many of our businesses, while other areas still need more work.
Operational we get stronger with each passing months and just as important, our innovation engine continues to hum and expect that the pace of innovation will accelerate the rest of the year.
With that, let me turn it over to Cathie to provide a deeper look at the financial performance and our outlook.
Cathie Lesjak
Thanks Meg. Overall, we delivered revenue of $26.8 billion down 5% year-over-year or down 2% in constant currency. Despite currency headwinds and even as we continue to increase our R&D investments, we improved profitability year-over-year. Gross margin was 23.4% up 0.6 points year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter gross margin was down 1.2 points in line with normal seasonality.
Non-GAAP operating profit was 8.8% up 0.3 points year-over-year. We are nearing the completion of our 2012 restructuring plan. In Q1 about 2,800 people exited the company making the total reduction to-date approximately 44,000. We are on track to complete this existing program with a total of 55,000 people expected to exit by the end of fiscal 2015.
However, we do anticipate incremental opportunities for operational improvements identified through the separation process. Our non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.92 primarily excludes pre-tax charges of $222 million for amortization of intangible assets, a $146 million for restructuring and $80 million associated with the separation. Including these charges GAAP diluted net earnings per share for Q1 was $0.73 in line with our previously provided outlook of $0.72 to $0.76 per share.
Turning to the business performance, in personal systems revenue grew 3% in constant currency or flat as reported. We out grew the market and gained share across all regions while increasing profitability year-over-year to 3.7%. We saw particular strength in notebooks and continued to rollout exciting products.
While commercial revenue was up only 1% in constant currency following the XP migration. We saw an increase in consumer momentum with 4% revenue growth in constant currency. In printing, revenue declined 4% year-over-year in constant currency or 5% as reported with some challenges in both hardware and supplies and particular weakness in Russia. Profitability remained strong at 19.2%; declines in low end home and single function minor laser hardware units drove overall units down 4% year-over-year.
While it will take sometime to turn the corner, we continue to make progress in our strategy of improving the quality of our installed base. Our unit mix improved with solid growth in key high usage products like Office Jet Pro X and value multifunction printers.
Graphics performance remains strong with our 6th consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth. The increase in scale as contributed to a year-over-year increase in operating profit also in managed print services we saw a double-digit total contract value growth year-over-year.
Although we still saw declines in overall supplies revenue, we continue to improve that revenue trajectory and ink, while managing ink and toner channel inventory within desired ranges.
Overall supplies revenue mix was 55% of total print revenue. The enterprise group performed well with revenue up 3% in constant currency or flat as reported with strong profitability of 15.6%. ISS revenue grew 9% in constant currency or 7% as reported, with growth across all regions and strength in core rock and blades categories.
We also saw some recovery in business critical systems with revenue down only 7% in constant currency or 9% as reported. In storage performance improved in Q1 with revenue up 3% year-over-year in constant currency or flat as reported. Converged storage was up 21% now making up 50% of total storage revenue. 3PAR, plus XP, plus EVA was up 12% year-over-year, all flash 3PAR revenue accelerated now making up 20% of total 3PAR mid-range portfolio.
Also we expect to be the only scale vendor to gain external disk share year-over-year for the last 12 quarters. In networking revenue was down 9% year-over-year in constant currency or down 11% as reported. However, we continue to see positive momentum in our data center and switching business which grew for the 5th consecutive quarter. And while we had execution issues in the US and China, we delivered solid revenue growth in the rest of the world.
Technology services revenue was down 2% year-over-year and constant currency are down 5% as reported. Owners grew in constant currency driven by support in EMEA and strong renewals. Enterprise services revenue was down 8% year-over-year on constant currency or down 11% as reported.
Application and business services in IT outsourcing were each down 11% as key account run off and weakness in EMEA offset the momentum weâre seeing in strategic enterprise services or services for the new style of IT.
Profitability improved year-over-year to 3% up 1.9 points driven primarily by productivity actions and improved margins in underperforming accounts. Also the sales team increased efficiency with improved win rates and reduced selling cost.
Total contract value was up with double-digit growth in renewals, in new logos and in SCS signing with particular strength in key areas including cloud and big data. Software revenue was down 3% year-over-year on constant year or down 5% as reported, as we faced execution challenges and headwinds from our shift to SaaS.
Profitability was 18% up 2.2 points year-over-year as we effectively managed cost well increasing R&D investment in strategic areas such as big data and security. Finally, in HP financial services revenue declined 4% year-over-year in constant currency or down 8% as reported, due to an early contract termination in the prior year period making for a tough compare for revenue and operating profit.
However, we experienced double digit new volume growth and record high attach rate to HPâs products and services. ROE was just over 17% and HP financial services continues to be a key differentiator for HP.
Before we get to the outlook, I want to spend a bit more time helping you understand how currency impacts our business. With two-thirds of our revenue coming from outside of the US, the impact from currency movements is significant. As Meg said, we have taken down our full year non-GAAP earnings outlook and this is entirely due to the currency challenges she described.
We continued to offset currency movements as much as possible through hedging strategies. We have rolling hedging program, which are designed to minimize the volatility of results of dampening large fluctuations. However, significant and sustained currency moves cannot be managed by hedges alone. We also use repricing as a lever when possible considering competitive market dynamics.
The hedging programs vary by business depending upon these factors. As an example personal systems and our EG hardware businesses have very little and natural hedges as our component contracts are typically in US dollars. As a result these businesses are disproportionately impacted by currency movements.
However, we do have some ability to increase pricing in response to currency movements, while being mindful of competition and potential negative impacts to customer demand. In printing, we have a lot of moving parts with currency impacting our business both directly and indirectly, like the other segments the printing business is negatively impacted by the strength of the dollar on the top and bottom-line.
The weaker again helps the cost side of our business, but it also allows our Japanese competitors to price much more aggressively. In addition, printing specifically the laser business is overweight in Russia, which has it had another dimension to currency impacts.
Services have more natural hedges since revenue and expenses are not closely matching the same currency. But due to the nature of contracts, repricing in response to currency movements is less of a lever. Across all of our businesses, we will continue to manage the currency challenge well also making the right trade off to support our strategy for long-term success.
We discuss the currency impact for the P&L, but now let me talk about the balance sheet. As we discussed last quarter, we hedge our balance sheet based on anticipated net monitory assets and liabilities. Any hedge gains or losses are reported within the other assets and liabilities section and not the specific cash flow line item.
Across the specific line items in Q1, we saw the largest impact from currency on working capital and financing receivables. The change to our cash conversion cycle would suggest a working capital headwind year-over-year of approximately $750 million. But the actual headwind is approximately $1.1 billion when including the hedge gain that is reported in other assets and liabilities. Similarly the cash headwind from reported financing receivable appears in the statement of cash flows to be approximately $100 million, but is actually closer to $250 million when including this adjustment.
The offset means that the headwind of approximately $1.3 billion in other assets and liabilities is actually a lower headwind of about $800 million. Making this distinction is important, so we can focus on the true drivers of cash flow.
Next I want to discuss cash flow and capital allocation. In Q1 cash flow from operations was $744 million and free cash flow was negative $73 million. We had several factors impacting our operating and free cash flow in Q1, remember Q1 is typically the lowest cash flow quarter for HP and we did expect this to be true again in fiscal 2015.
Having said that, the cash flow results were down year-over-year and somewhat below our expectations and I want to take a minute to explain. First, we had a working capital impact. The cash conversion cycle increased sequentially in Q1 2015, but declined sequentially in Q1 2014, which created a headwind of about $1.1 billion net of hedging.
While we anticipated a lot of this day sales outstanding was higher than expected largely due to non-recurring operational issues in the quarter, intermonth linearity in January and other smaller factors. Some of these smaller factors may continue and are captured in our outlook.
We still expect the cash conversion cycle to be 10 to 12 days by year end as we continue to make the right tradeoff between the use of cash and P&L optimization. As an example, we may decide to ship finished goods by both boat versus by plane, which increases inventory but reduces cost of sales.
Similarly taking advantage of early paid discounts from suppliers reduces cost but decreases accounts payable. We do a full cost benefit announcements to make sure these decisions drive economic value.
Next we had a tough compare. Q1 2014 included proceeds from a large real estate sale which drove an increase in net CapEx year-over-year in Q1 2015. Finally there were several other unfavorable movements in Q1 2015. We had double digit capital lease volume growth, which obviously is great for our business. But this was a greater use of cash this year than last.
We also ended the quarter with higher receivables from vendor rebates and contract manufacturers as well as lower litigation reserves. And we made restructuring payments earlier in the year than expected. I want to reemphasize that while Q1 cash flow was down year-over-year, we remain confident in our ability to generate cash as we demonstrated over many quarters. We are providing an updated outlook to-date to our cash flow. But the reduction from our $6.5 billion to $7 billion outlook last quarter is only due to currency and separation impacts we have announced today.
Turning to capital allocation. In Q1 we repurchased $41.4 million shares and paid $304 million in dividends for our total capital return to shareholders of $1.9 billion. This makes up for the $750 million shortfall from our fiscal 2014 commitment to return at least 50% of free cash flow to shareholders.
Turning to the separation, as we discussed on the last earnings call, we will incur incremental separation cost and foreign tax expenses in both fiscal 2015 and 2016 associated with separating into two companies. The scale of this separation is unprecedented in its size and complexity.
Over the past few months we designed and quantified the expected charges related to the separation. These charges include finance, IT, consulting and legal fees, real estate and other items that are incremental and one-time in nature and not reflective of our operational performance.
In addition, weâve estimated our incremental foreign tax expenses related to the separation of foreign legal entities. The charges and taxes associated with the separation are excluded from our non-GAAP earnings.
The Q1 GAAP charge associated with the separation was $80 million and we expect the Q2 GAAP charge to be approximately $250 million. For the year fiscal 2015 charges are expected to be $1.3 billion and the FYâ16 estimate is $500 million. While these are large numbers, they represent less than 2% of our annual operating cost and are necessary to realize the potential of the separation into two world class companies.
Separation related capital spend this year is expected to be approximately $300 million. The incremental gross foreign tax expenses are estimated to be about $950 million in fiscal 2015. We do expect more than half of the tax expenses to be offset by foreign tax credit.
In fiscal 2015, we anticipated credit of about $200 million and the rest over the next few years. We will continue to provide updates on our separation on our quarterly call. Turning to the outlook for Q2 and the remainder of fiscal 2015. From a macro perspective, weâve already talked about the impact associated with currency shift. Additionally, we see continued challenges across certain geographies including China where we anticipate increasing competitiveness from local vendors, and Russia were political and economic concerns are ongoing.
These challenges are being offset to some degree by strengthening of the US economy, by business. In personal systems while the PC market is expected to continue to contract, we planned to leverage our brand channel scale and strong product line up to continue to gain share profitably. We will take advantage of the momentum in consumer and continue our strategic focus on commercial including commercial mobility.
In printing, we are planning to be more aggressive in placing hardware units with continued focus on high value units. We will manage supplies channel inventory closely while driving further stability in supplies revenue in fiscal 2015.
In enterprise group we expect several momentum to continue with the Gen9 line up and server refresh cycle. We expect storage particularly 3PAR to outperform key competitors especially in the mid-range.
In networking, we expect continued challenges in the near-term, but are making adjustments to improve execution. In enterprise services we expect continued improvement in profitability making progress towards our long-term goal of 7% to 9% operating profit and remain confident in our full year operating margin outlook of 4% to 6%.
Given the current revenue trajectory and the expectation that currency will continue to be a headwind, we are providing a new enterprise services full year revenue outlook. Because, of the currency volatility going forward we will provide this on a constant currency basis.
We now expect the full year revenue to decline 4% to 6%; we expect year-over-year revenue performance improvement in the second half of fiscal 2015. In software we planned to continue to shift our go-to-market focus and further align our product portfolio to best capture the growing SaaS opportunity.
We also have much more work to do to drive consistent sales execution across the organization. Overall for fiscal 2015, we remain optimistic about the market opportunity and our competitive positioning. However, the currency headwind at current rates cannot be fully absorbed.
Weâve done detailed modeling using current exchange rates and assumptions for repricing and productivity. With all that in mind, we are updating fiscal 2015 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share outlook to be $3.53 to $3.73 which is lower by $0.30 due to currency headwinds.
Fiscal 2015 GAAP diluted net earnings per share outlook is in the range of $2.03 to $2.23. Q2 fiscal 2015 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share outlook is expected to be in the range of $0.84 to $0.88 which includes $0.09 of currency pressure. Q2 fiscal 2015 GAAP diluted net earnings per share outlook is in the range of $0.57 to $0.61.
Given the updated earnings outlook for currency and the introduction of cash related separation activities we are updating our fiscal 2015 free cash flow outlook to be approximately $3.5 billion to $4 billion.
With that letâs open it up for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Sherri Scribner of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Sherri Scribner
Hi thanks, Meg you are now a couple of months in this separation and I have seen that you gotten more detail on where you can find some additional savings. I was hoping you could talk through some of the additional savings you expect and also how you feel about the separation at this point, three months? Thanks.
Meg Whitman
Yes. Great, Sherri. So we are making real progress on the separation, recall that we are separating into two Fortune 50 companies, I mean itâs sort of hard to imagine that there are two Fortune 50 companies embedded in HP. And that has included an entire organizational design and selection process the IT strategy carve out financials and many other activities.
And I think actually we are executing on all cylinders; there has not been distraction to the core business. Weâve got a dedicated team focusing on the separation and the rest of the company is focused on delivering for customers. And I feel very good about that and also the feedback from partners and customers has been terrific.
So lots and lots of work ahead, but I feel good about where we are, it has surfaced lots of opportunities for continued cost savings and the ability to operate more efficiently. And when you care a part of company thatâs been built up over many years through acquisition, through different systems being merged together, itâs remarkable what you find.
And whether it is single owner end-to-end cost structure, the ability to benchmark versus our competitors on how many spans and layers we have, the ability to make small changes in the portfolio that we want to go forward with, lots and lots of opportunities thatâs going to make us much stronger as we go forward as two independent companies.
So weâre pretty excited about it, it is a huge amount of work, but I have to say itâs accelerating because we see the future where these two companies will be far more cost competitive than even we are today as HPQ.
Jim Bergkamp
Thanks Sherri, next question please.
Operator
The next question will come from Maynard Um of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
Maynard Um
Hi thanks, can you just talk a little bit about the Deutsche Bank deal, my impression of the scope of the deal was much deeper than may be somewhat think you have the capability to provide. Maybe if you can just give us more specifics around that, detail around the deal what was a primary driver to the win where there any particular products or solutions that were central to it. And then maybe just related to them weâd generally talk about where you are in services bookings and where you expect that to be? Thanks.
Meg Whitman
So weâre very proud of the Deutsche Bank win and it was a full on one HP effort including our enterprise group, our software business, our cloud business as well as our services business and it was a services led win. And I believe the reason that we won is we had the best technical solution for what Deutsche Bank needed, which was to reduce cost, reduce cost significantly by the way increase agility and migrate to a new world order of CICD DevOps and a cloud-based environment.
So I think we showed up with the best team, with the best technical solution and a competitive price. As you know this is a long sales cycle business. I think we first engaged with Deutsche Bank over 18 months ago maybe even closer to two years. So, these are long standing deals, but weâre very excited because, everyone in the industry wanted this business it was a hallmark or lighthouse account and we did it on our terms. So we feel pretty good about it, I would say Helion was a big part of the differentiated solution. I think our ability to provide global support on an unprecedented scale was an important part of the win. And our ability advice and transform, the key risk in these deals is how do you get from where you are to where you need to be and I think we were judged to be the safest pair of hands.
Jim Bergkamp
Thanks Maynard. Next question.
Operator
The next question will come from Toni Sacconaghi of Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.
Toni Sacconaghi
Yes. Thank you. I was wondering if - I was wondering if you could comment on your revenue expectation for this year, you were down about 2.5% on constant currency this quarter. I think the goal was to be about flat at constant currency for this year. Do you still believe you can achieve that and I guess given some of the commentary around geographies et cetera it would seem not, and so perhaps I go back to you Meg and say youâre on track, but it actually feels like your little bit behind track in terms of where you thought revenues may have been for this year?
Meg Whitman
So we still believe we can now be flat in constant currency in FYâ15 and as you can imagine we have put a lot of thought into this, because the macroeconomic environment particularly in places like Russia where we are over exposed in China is pretty challenging. But listen we did well in PSG very well in industry standard servers and this is perhaps the biggest turnaround over the last couple of years. This was a very troubled business two years ago and the team as done a remarkable job. Graphics and print is doing incredibly well. And ES and this will be the key to flat constant currency, as we expect better revenue performance in the second half from ES.
Profitability was good in Q1, but we expect to have a much slower rate of decline by the end of the year and Deutsche, TNT other wins are important to that. So I am optimistic that we will be flat in constant currency, listen if there is another major geopolitical disruption that could be off the table, but as we sit here today, we think flat in constant currency. Cathie do you want to add anything to do that?
Cathie Lesjak
I wouldnât, I donât think I can add anything to that, I agree. I think that we will ultimately be roughly flat in constant currency and then the key is going to be enterprise services. And we announced Deutsche Bank, weâve already run in Q2 a couple of big deals, the other ones not public yet, but that is going to give us some help in the second half as this is the fact that the key account run off that weâve been talking about really abate in the second half of the year, as weâre getting largely through it.

The next question will come from Katie Huberty - Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Katie Huberty
Yes. Thank you. Cathie in your cash flow discussion you mentioned intermonth linearity in January as a factor impacting DSOs and therefore for cash flow. And I wonder if you can expand on that in part, because other enterprise hardware companies have said in the month of January they started to see delays in spending as global customers have to deal with the currency impact on their own business and therefore are dealing, spending and revisiting their budget. And I just wonder whether you and Meg think that could be a risk that places out this year? Thank you.
Meg Whitman
So Katie thatâs really not what weâre hearing in terms of - when we think about the quarter, it wasnât so much that we were seeing kind of enterprise customers delaying as a result of the currency. Thatâs really not we are hearing. We did see some softness in January overall, in the PC business. And so it was, the quarter was a bit more frontend loaded than what would be kind of our historical norm. But when you look at overall HP in January and then you look at what we had expected and I think this is really important, because when I was talking about the cash flow implication it was really relative to our expectations and what around cash flow. We had expected a January that was better balanced first half to second half, and what we saw was actually a bit more that got shifted from the first half to the second half, and that impacted obviously DSO.
Cathie Lesjak
And Iâll just time into that Katie, we have a great channel from our sales force to us and weâre on out in the field all the time with customers, Iâm not actually hearing that. Now thatâs for me that wonât turn out, but weâre not hearing the people are delaying purchases, because budgets are tightening and things like that.
Katie Huberty

The next question will come from Rod Hall of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Rod Hall
Yes. Hi, guys thanks. I just wanted to drill into the networking commentary a little bit, you guys had said that, I think you were little bit disappointed in the performance in the quarter, you made some interesting announcements last week with regards to Brite Box switches. That you seem to be doing a lot of things in networking, I just wonder if Meg you could maybe talk a little about the strategy there, do you guys intend to consolidate the strategy around Brite Box do you intend to have a broad spectrum of product offering. You just help us understand how this strategy might be involving there?
Meg Whitman
So network is a very important business to HP, you recall from a financial architecture perspective networking storage are margin accretive. And so these are important businesses to us and we will continue to invest in these businesses. You are right we had two execution challenges one in China and one in the US and I think we touched on those. The strategy here is exactly the same strategy in many ways that weâve deployed with servers, which is a market segmentation strategy. What kind of customers want to buy, what kind of gear and then we need to have that for them. So for example in servers we have high performance compute and we have terrific data center switches and wired and wireless LAN product.
But we also have benefited by having a hyperscale offering through our joint venture with Foxconn in the server business, which led to the thesis we should have a white-box strategy for our networking business, because there is a lot of people for who that is the solution that they prefer. And better for us to offer it and surround with other HP product and services than walk away from that market segment entirely. We are very clear that we only play in businesses in which we can grow profitably we have no interest in losing money in any business. And we believe in this new opportunity that we announced that we will make money there. So it is a market segmentation based strategy where we have to have the right product with the right services attach that allows us to make money and gain share. So rougher than anticipated quarter at networking, it doesnât deter us, we just know we got to make a couple of changes to execute better.
Rod Hall
Okay thank you.

The next question will come from Steve Milunovich of UBS. Please go ahead.
Steve Milunovich
Thank you. Meg, I wonder if you could talk about your playing to win framework thatâs not something youâve spoken about much and from what Iâve heard about it, it sounds like itâs fairly important and particularly to the discipline in execution of HP is that true?
Meg Whitman
It is true actually, the entire company has organized around playing to win which is book written by A.G. Lafley and a colleague of his and listen there is many ways to deploy strategy in company. This is one that I have found to be particularly helpful. Because organizations have a lot of trouble making choices, particularly at our scale. So this notion of where to play what countries, what market segments, what products and weâre not to play because, we canât do it profitably is been a very good discipline and actually Dion Weisler has led the way in printing and personal systems.
And then once you determine where you are going to play how to win and that is through a combination of where you are going to excel versus competitors. And itâs actually been a really good common framework that we can apply across HP itâs easily understandable and actually forces the tough tradeoff. So listen as I said there is lots of ways to deploy strategy, but this has been particularly I think effective at HP, because everyone speaks the same language now.
Steve Milunovich

The next question will come from Jim Suva of Citigroup. Please go ahead.
Jim Suva
Great, thanks very much. Cathie, can you just help us bridge with difference of the current free cash flow guidance of $3.5 billion to $4 billion versus the prior of $6.5 billion to $7 billion, just help us quantify or understand the bridge of the - where the $3 billion go to, lot of the timing things over a long-term where there is inventory payables or whether it should kind of wash out. So if you can help us understand on a yearly basis where the 43 billion went?
Cathie Lesjak
Sure. And Jim youâre absolutely right, the softness that we saw in free cash flow in Q1 was largely the result of timing. And so we donât believe it has an impact to the total year. So if we go, if we start with the $6.5 billion to $7 billion that was the outlook back in November, you then take into consideration the separation cost for a fiscal 2015 which are $1.3 billion. Youâve got incremental foreign taxes net of credits in the year that are about $750 million of cash out flow and then youâve got the separation CapEx which is about $300 million. And finally youâve got $0.30 share for currency. And that takes you to the $3.5 billion to $4 billion of free cash flow for 2015.
Jim Suva
So with the original separation cost of $1.3 billion was not in the $6.5 billion to $7 billion?
Cathie Lesjak
Thatâs right, and if you actually go back on to this, we were pretty clear on the fact that we had not quantified to the point where we were comfortable giving explicit guidance about what the separation cost were going to be three months ago, we actually have spent a tremendous amount of time kind of identifying and quantifying what that was going to be.
The other thing I would mean, Iâm sorry Jim go ahead.
Jim Suva
Okay thatâs terrific clarification, so itâs really the add-on of separation cost and currency?
Cathie Lesjak
Thatâs right, thatâs the only change that weâve got to our outlook for free cash for the year the base to start with is the $6.5 billion to $7 billion that we provided last quarter.

The next question will come from Ben Reitzes of Barclays. Please go ahead.
Ben Reitzes
Hey good afternoon, thanks. I wanted to ask about your pricing commentary, the 19.2% margin in printing doesnât seem indicative of a nasty pricing environment it actually seems like the opposite, I know you got the yen flowing through there. But I wanted to understand the pricing comment better, does that mean the printing margins are really going to fall a lot due to pricing in upcoming quarters and what does it really mean when youâre balancing the facts that margins are at these historical heights and you are saying there is pricing pressure? Thanks a lot.
Meg Whitman
Yes. So we do think that the 19.2% profitability and really the profitability over the last quarter or two as been unsustainably high. And remember the business model as we price printers at a loss in exchange for a long-term annuity, but I have actually asked Dion Weisler to join us on the call today and so Dion you might comment a little about that.
Dion Weisler
Yes. I think youâre quite right Meg. We donât believe that 19% OP is for the business long-term and therefore it is not sustainable over the last several quarters weâve made real operational improvements. Weâve also had cost benefit from the weakness of the yen which is of course the double head sword, on the one hand it helps us lower cost and on the other have fees Japanese competitors have leveraged the yen to be more aggressive on unit placement which we need to respond to.
So in order for us to maintain competitiveness, we need to invest some of these savings and weâll do that really in three ways, firstly weâll be more aggressive in placing more units with the keen focus on placing high value units that will drive future supplies growth. Secondly, weâll continue to expand our print sales specialist team to continue to drive growth in our managed print services business. And then finally, weâll invest in new technologies like PageWide Array that fuels everything from the Office Jet Pro X all the way through being the underpinning and underlying technology behind Multi Jet Fusion, which is of course the engine behind our 3D printers.
So of course, weâll continue to strike the right balance between growth and profitability, but we believe 19% operating profit is not good for the business long-term.
Cathie Lesjak
And I would like to also add, sorry Ben, I would like to also add that when you look at the benefit that weâre getting explicitly from the weakness of the yen in the back-half of the year that on a year-over-year basis is significant reduced even at the current levels of exchange rates there. So we do expect that some of that benefit kind of moves away from us. The other thing this is the only segment in Q1 where overall on a direct basis they had a positive impact from currency. So again IPG is a little bit different than the other businesses, itâs got the same top-line and bottom-line pressures from the strength of the dollar. It does have a benefit from the weakness of the yen and then it does have to deal with Russia. But in Q1, the net currency impact was actually positive. We donât expect that continues in the rest of the year as the yen benefit basically moves away from us. And overtime we also hedge longer term especially in the supplies area in IPG and those hedges start to roll off as well.
Ben Reitzes
Yes. And the pricing hits there on the com, it sounds like. Okay.
Cathie Lesjak
Yes, yes.
Ben Reitzes
Okay. Thank you.

The next question will come from Wamsi Mohan of Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
Wamsi Mohan
Yes. Thank you. Could you help us think through the dynamics of PC unit growth this year, for the quarter obviously the metrics were pretty strong, but I know you comment that about January starting off weak, how are you expecting this to progress through the course of the year in any given OpEx or that will be helpful? Thank you.
Meg Whitman
Iâm sorry couldnât exactly hear you the dynamics of the, are you looking for the PC what happened to PCs in January.
Wamsi Mohan
Long-term view, I think was the question.
Meg Whitman
Okay, why donât you take that then, okay, yes, Dion, you can talk about the long-term view that you have.
Dion Weisler
Yes so look, I think in January weâre pretty aligned with the industry projections of the personal systems market, weâd suggest sort of low single digit growth. We believe that PC units will be in small decline, but there are pockets of growth across the segments, in some segments including mobility, accessories and services. We have seen an expected slowdown in the commercial segment following the XP refresh that fueled high growth last year. However, weâve seen to counter balance that momentum in the consumer side of the business as consumers refresh their older PCs.
So looking forward the market remains competitive, we believe we can continue to gain share in the areas where we choose to play as the market consolidates. Specifically we sort of focused on profitable growth in three areas firstly weâre investing in key growth areas of convertibles, commercial mobility, accessories and services with the 80s in the market. Secondly, we remain focused on extending our leadership in the commercial enterprise and SMB segments including education. And then finally, we discontinued due to the hard work of detailed customer segmentation and ensuring that we have the right price value and cost equation set for each market.
Meg Whitman
And I would say that, while we are manically focused on the commercial space, in Q1 and what weâre seeing is a little bit of a refresh in the consumer space. And this is where being focused on profitable growth is really important, there is a lot of bad growth in consumer, but there is also good growth and one of the things that I just want to make sure that people are clear on is that we donât get hung up on the margin rate. If we can go after good units in the consumer space across HP Stream being Chromebook and we can deliver incremental margin dollars then weâll go after that.
And we definitely saw some real opportunities in Q1, it helped us gain pretty significant share on the consumer side, while also driving some incremental profit dollars obviously at a much lower rate.
Wamsi Mohan
Thank you.
Jim Bergkamp

The next question will come from Aaron Rakers of Stifel Nicolaus. Please go ahead.
Aaron Rakers
Yes. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask about the Industry Standard Server segment and where we stand on the Grantley or the Gen9 server cycle. So, what have you seen so far, where are you adding that cycle and whatâs your expectations for that product cycle relative to not just the Grantley cycle but also the Windows server expiration through the course of this year?
Meg Whitman
So specifically with the -- with respect to the Gen9, the ramp in Gen9 is off to a terrific start, is actually one of the fastest ramps that weâve seen its certainly ramping faster than better than Gen8. What we see in the product line up in Gen9 which is different than Gen8 is that weâve got basically, weâve got a great entry product all the way up to the high end. And so, weâre very pleased with the progress you saw that drive - help drive a lot of growth in industry standard servers 9% year-over-year in constant currency. And we expect that will continue to ramp basically through the year.
In terms of the kind of Windows 2003 refresh, itâs starting, but it is not a material impact at this point. Itâs really just beginning, we do expect that will ramp as we go through fiscal 2015, but it was not a major factor at all in the performance that we delivered in industry standard servers this quarter.
The combination of Gen9 and the refresh cycle makes us fairly bullish on industry standard servers kind of throughout the rest of 2015 and you might talk a little about the margin work weâve done in that business.
Sure, good point, we have done the margins have improved very significantly, the gross margins in industry standard servers this quarter. Weâve done a great job of driving product cost down taking advantage of some favorable commodity pricing as well. But itâs really been hard work at driving the right cost structure combined with the opportunity to drive attach. So in ASPs weâve got double digit increases in ASPs in industry standard server and thatâs because the Gen9 ProLiant server basically drives a lot of memory and storage attach which is obviously great for margins.
The last thing I would say is, I think weâre really well positioned to take advantage of the Windows 2003 refresh just as we were from the XP migration and the PC business, I mean we actually modeled the program after the XP program and that has been helped by our adjustment to our coverage models in the United States and APGI in Europe. And with Cathie, I think we feel really pretty good about that business for the reminder of the year and I think weâre very well positioned and the Gen9 server was dead on from the market perspective.
Jim Bergkamp
Thanks. I think we have time for one more question.
Operator
And the final question will be from Shannon Cross of Cross Research. Please go ahead.
Shannon Cross
Thank you very much for taking my question. Cathie can you talk a bit about how we should think about free cash flow for 2016 and what Iâm trying to figure out is, you say $750 million for foreign tax, I think the total was $900 million. So, was offset of the credits and the costs in 2016 kind of balanced themselves out and theoretically restructuring somewhat through, so maybe we get back sort of more to that normal cadence, and Iâm sure you probably donât want to put a number on it. But just to the extent that you can, give us some idea of puts and takes we should think about as we look to 2016 since obviously weâre going to have to cut our 2015 cash flow estimate pretty significantly.
Cathie Lesjak
So, the biggest headwind to free cash flow this year over last year is the cash conversion cycle, basically going to back to 10 to 12 days. And I think itâs important to understand that the reason why it goes back to 10 to 12 days is because we are taking what is now our strong balance sheet and leveraging that balance sheet to drive shareholder value by making trade off across the P&L and the balance sheet. Thatâs what is driving the 10 to 12 days. But once we get to that 10 to 12 days the year-on-year compare for 2016 and that headwind is significantly reduced. So thatâs one of the big kind of tailwinds to cash flow, you are absolutely right the separation cost are going to come down. So and the separation cost is anticipated to be $1.3 billion in fiscal 2015 and about $500 million in fiscal 2016. We donât think there is separation CapEx, the foreign taxes will turn to credit. I donât know how much weâre going to get in credits in fiscal 2016, but certainly you donât have the headwind basically $750 million.
So, I think those are, and then currency weâll have to see what happens from a currency perspective exactly what will happen. But obviously you wouldnât have another step down unless the currency moves against again.
Shannon Cross
And is there any changeâ¦
Cathie Lesjak
Sorry go ahead.
Meg Whitman
No. I was just going to say Shannon and obviously towards the end of the year as we get close to actually the legal separation of these two companies, weâll be very explicit about the balance sheet that each company has and the earnings, revenue growth, free cash flow of each company. So, as we head into 2016, weâll be able to give you the kind of guidance that we gave when we were one company, weâll just do it for two.
Shannon Cross
And you changed your cash usage this year given the lower cash balance, I think lower cash generation?
Cathie Lesjak
Are you specifically asking about capital allocation, because Iâd love to address that.
Shannon Cross
Yes. Thatâs exactly.
Meg Whitman
So our commitment to basically provide at least 50% of our free cash flow this year back to shareholders in the form of share repurchase and dividends is still intact. And in fact if you do the math on Q1, in Q1 we repurchased shares to the tune of about $1.6 billion, about $750 million of that is basically making up for the shortfall that we had in 2014 from our commitment. So weâve got about $850 million done in share repurchase for fiscal 2015. If you actually then look out over the course of the year and forecast what you think the dividends are going to be, you come pretty rapidly to the conclusion that we are at or down close to hitting 50% of free cash flow already in terms of returns to shareholder. And what is important is that, our guidance is, and our commitment is at least 50% of free cash flow will be returned to shareholders.
Shannon Cross
Thank you.
Meg Whitman
Great. Well, thank you very much. I think weâre out of time. Thank you very much for joining us. I think we feel very strong, the turnaround is on track. There is progress, you can see it in terms of margin expansion across all of the major lines of business. You can see it in growth in areas of the company that, I think people were not sure we would turnaround like industry standard servers and PCs. So lots of progress, lots more work to do and obviously the macroeconomic environment largely currency is a headwind that disproportionately affects HP. But overall we feel really good about the operational execution of the company. So thank you for joining us.
