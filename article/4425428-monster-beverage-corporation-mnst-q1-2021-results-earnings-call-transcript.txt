Rodney Sacks
Thank you, Tom. The companyâs top priority remains the health, safety and well-being of its employees. The companyâs flavor manufacturing facilities, its co-packers, warehouses and shipment facilities have operated throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. The companyâs bottlers and distributors are operating and the companyâs products remain generally available to consumers. In limited countries, the operations of the companyâs bottlers or distributors have, in part be negatively affected for varying periods of time.
Despite the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the company achieved record first quarter net sales. Currently, the company does not foresee a material impact on the ability of its co-packers to manufacture and its bottlers and distributors to distribute its products as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The companyâs supply chain remains largely intact. However, the company is experiencing shortages in its aluminum can requirements in North America and Europe given the companyâs volume growth and the current supply constraints in the aluminum can industry. The company has taken steps to source quantities of aluminum cans from South America and Asia. However, logistical issues, including ocean freight and port of entry congestion, could delay such supply. Logistical issues in relation to the importation of certain other raw materials and ingredients could impact future supply. Furthermore, we are continuing to experience freight inefficiencies and like other beverage companies are incurring increased aluminum can and other costs in the current environment.
In the first quarter of 2021, net sales were $1.24 billion compared to $1.06 billion in the first quarter of 2020, an increase of 17.1%. Adjusting for foreign currency movements, net sales for the 2021 first quarter would have been up 16.2%. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the 2021 first quarter was 57.5% and compared with 60% in this 2020 first quarter. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the 3 months ended March 31, 2021 was primarily the result of increased input costs mainly increased raw material freight-in costs, geographical sales mix and higher promotional allowances as a percentage of net sales.
Operating expenses for the 2021 first quarter were $300.8 million compared with $272.2 million in the 2020 first quarter. As a percentage of net sales, operating expenses for the 2021 first quarter were 24.2% compared with 25.6% in the 2020 first quarter. Operating income increased 13.5% to $414.1 million, up from $365 million in the first quarter of 2020. Net income increased 13% to $315.2 million as compared to $278.8 million in the 2020 comparable quarter. Diluted earnings per share for the 2021 first quarter increased 14.2% to $0.59 from $0.52 in the first quarter of 2020.

The Nielsen statistics for Mexico cover single months, which is a short period that may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by sales in the OXXO convenience chain, which dominates the market. Sales in the OXXO convenience chain in turn can be materially influenced by promotions that maybe undertaken in that chain by one or more energy drink brands during a particular month. Consequently, such activities could have a significant impact on the monthly Nielsen statistics for Mexico. According to Nielsen, for the month of March 2021 compared to March 2020, Monsterâs retail market share in value increased in Argentina from 37.9% to 45.2% and in Brazil from 25.4% to 34.7%. In Chile, Monsterâs retail market share decreased from 42.1% to 40%. Monster Energy continues to be the leading energy brand in value in Argentina.
I would like to point out that the Nielsen numbers in EMEA should only be used as a guide, because the channels read by Nielsen in EMEA vary from country to country and are reported on varying dates within the month referred to from country to country. According to Nielsen, in the 13-week period ended April 4, 2021, Monsterâs retail market share in value as compared to the same period the previous year grew from 15.8% to 16% in Germany, from 19.7% to 28.1% in Italy, and from 17.3% to 20.6% in South Africa. According to Nielsen in the 13-week period till the end of March 2021, Monsterâs retail market share in value as compared to the same period the previous year grew from 13.2% to 15.1% in Belgium; from 12.6% to 14.8% in the Czech Republic; from 24.5% to 26.4% in Denmark; from 28% to 31.8% in France; from 22.7% to 27.9% in Great Britain; from 34% to 37.7% in Greece; from 6.4% to 8% in the Netherlands; from 24.7% to 29.1% in Norway; from 15.3% to 18.2% in Poland; from 23.8% to 28% in the Republic of Ireland; and from 34% to 36% in Spain; and from 13.5% to 14.9% in Sweden. The Nielsen numbers in EMEA should only be used as a guide, because the channels read by Nielsen in EMEA vary from country to country.
According to IRI in Australia, Monsterâs market share in value for the 4 weeks ended April 11, 2021 increased from 10% to 13.1% as compared to the same period the previous year. Motherâs market share in value decreased from 13.6% to 11.8% during the same period. The market share of the companyâs brands in Australia for the 4 weeks ended April 11, 2021 increased from 23.6% to 24.9%. According to IRI in New Zealand, Monsterâs market share in value for the 4 weeks ended April 18, 2021 increased from 9.9% to 12.7% as compared to the same period the previous year. Live+âs market share in value decreased from 7.4% to 6.5% and Motherâs market share in value decreased from 6.5% to 5.6%.

According to Nielsen, in South Korea, Monsterâs market share in value in all outlets combined for the month of March 2021 increased from 52.3% to 54.8% as compared to the same period in the previous year. According to INTAGE in Japan, Monsterâs market share in value in the convenience store channel for the month of March 2021 decreased from 62.1% to 50.1% as compared to the same period in the previous year. Monster remains the market leader in Japan. However, our share was negatively impacted by the labeling issue of a product referenced in our fourth quarter 2020 release, which was re-listed on retail shelves in April 2021 by the introduction of new SKUs by new competitor and by the timing of our 2021 innovation. We again pointed out that certain market statistics that cover single months or 4-week periods may often be materially influenced positively and/or negatively by promotions or other trading factors during those periods.
Net sales to customers outside the U.S. was $459.4 million, a 36.9% of total net sales in the 2021 first quarter compared with $356.8 million and 33.6% of total net sales in the corresponding quarter in 2020. Foreign currency exchange rates had the effect of increasing net sales in U.S. dollars by approximately $9.3 million in the 2021 first quarter. Included in reported geographic sales are our sales to the companyâs military customers, which are delivered in the U.S. and transshipped to the military and their customers overseas.
In EMEA, net sales in the 2021 first quarter increased 27.7% in dollars and increased 21.2% in local currencies over the same period in 2020. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales in the first quarter was 37.3% compared to 43.1% in the same quarter in 2020 primarily...
Tom Kelly
41.3%, sorry.
Rodney Sacks
41.3% primarily due to unfavorable country and product mix. We are also pleased that in the 2021 first quarter, Monster gained market share in Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Germany, Great Britain, Greece, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, the Republic of Ireland, South Africa, Spain and Sweden.
In Asia-Pacific, net sales in the 2021 first quarter increased 24.8% in dollars and 17.4% in local currencies over the same period in 2020.

In Latin America, including Mexico and the Caribbean, net sales in the 2021 first quarter increased 35.7% in dollars and increased 55.9% in local currencies over the same period in 2020. Gross profit in this region as a percentage of net sales was 37.9% compared to 42.5% over the same period in 2020 primarily as a result of foreign exchange rates as certain raw materials and ingredients for products in this region are purchased in U.S. dollars. In Brazil, net sales in the 2021 first quarter increased by 34% in dollars and 70.1% in local currency. Net sales in Chile increased 48.9% in dollars and 37.7% in local currency in the 2021 first quarter.
Since our last earnings call in February 2021, there have been no significant updates on our litigation with Vital Pharmaceuticals Inc., the maker of Bang energy drinks. As this litigation and other pending proceedings with VPX are subjugate, we will not be answering any questions on this matter on todayâs call. In the United States, during early January 2021, we converted our 10-pack Monster portfolio into 12 packs. In late January 2021, we launched Reign Cherry Limeade and Reign White Gummy Bear as well as Reign Inferno Watermelon warlord. We also launched Monster Ultra Gold in singles and in a 4-pack. In late February 2021, we launched four core flavors: Monster Green, Low-Carb Monster, Monster Zero Ultra and Monster Ultra Paradise in 12-ounce slim cans targeted to the convenience retail channel and food service channel. In late March 2021, we converted our entire Monster Hydro portfolio into 20-ounce PET containers and added 2 new Monster Hydro Super Sport SKUs, Kilo Kiwi and Macho Mango. In late March 2021, we also launched Rehab Monster Strawberry Lemonade as the first non-tea option in the Rehab Monster brand family. We refreshed 2 SKUs during the first quarter of 2021, Monster Max Super Dry into Monster Nitro Super Dry in a 16-ounce can as well as a refreshed design on Monster result.
This summer, we are also planning to launch a new line of energy drinks under the True North brand name in 12-ounce sleek cans, which will contain an organic plant-based energy blend and ingredients for immunity support. Initially, True North will have a limited target in 2021, with plans for a full launch into mainstream channels in 2022. We are planning to launch additional new products later in 2021. In Canada, during early January 2021, we launched Monster Ultra Fiesta, Java Monster Oat Milk as well as Monster Ultra Paradise 4-pack. Later in February 2021, we launched Monster Ultra Paradise in singles as a 310 ml option. In early March 2021, we launched Reign Lilikoi Lychee singles and Reign Orange Dreamsicle in singles and a 4-pack. We also launched NOS Turbo in March 2021. In February 2021, we launched Pacific Punch in Mexico and in Honduras we launched Mean Green, our second flavor of Fury, which is one of our affordable energy brands. In March 2021, we launched Ultra Watermelon in Puerto Rico and Ultra Paradise in Aruba.
We introduced a number of SKUs across EMEA in the 2021 first quarter. Highlights include the geographical expansion of a number of existing Monster Reign and strategic brand products into new countries, including Juice Monster Pacific Punch, Juice Monster Monarch, which is Papillon in non-EMEA markets, Juice Monster Mango Loco, Juice Monster Pipeline Punch, Monster Ultra Paradise, Monster Ultra Fiesta, Monster Zero Ultra, Monster Ultra Blue, Black Monster Ultra Sunrise in Russia, Monster Mule, Burn Zero Peach and Play Zero Peach. Various Reign SKUs, including Reign Melon Mania, Sour Apple, Razzleberry, Peach Fuzz, Orange Dreamsicle and Lemonades were launched in Belgium; the Netherlands, South Africa, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Sweden and Germany in the first quarter of 2021.
In January 2021, we launched Ultra Rosa market-wide in Australia, following an exclusive lead launch with one chain in the fourth quarter of 2020. In March 2021 in New Zealand, we launched Monster Super Fuel in both Purple Passion and sugar-free flavors. During the 2021 first quarter in Japan, we launched Monster Energy Super Cola with our distributor, Asahi Soft Drinks. Additionally, we began shipments in the quarter in Japan for the re-launch at retail of Ultra Paradise in April 2021. During the 2021 first quarter, we launched Pipeline Punch in Hong Kong and Macau and began distribution of Monster Energy Zero Sugar in the Philippines. We are planning to launch a number of additional products and/or market lines in our domestic and international markets later this year.
During the 2021 first quarter, no shares were repurchased under the previously authorized repurchase program. As of May 6, 2021, approximately $441.5 million remained available for repurchase under the previously authorized repurchase program. We estimate April 2021 sales to be approximately 71.3% higher than in April 2020. On a foreign currency-adjusted basis, April 2021 sales would have been approximately 67.8% higher than comparable April 2020 sales. April 2021 had the same number of selling days as April 2020. Please keep in mind that the comparative April 2020 sales were materially adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.
In our 2020 first quarter conference call to shareholders, we reported that April 2020 sales were 22.2% lower than our April 2019 sales, with the same number of selling days in both periods. In this regard, we are caution again that sales over a short period are often disproportionately impacted by various factors, such as, for example, selling days, days of the week in which holidays fall, timing of new product launches, the timing of price increases and promotions in retail stores, distributor incentives as well as shifts in the timing of production, in some instances where our bottlers are responsible for production and unilaterally determine their production schedules, which affects the dates on which we invoice such bottlers as well as inventory levels maintained by our distribution partners, which they alter unilaterally for their own business reasons. We reiterate that sales over a short period such as a single month should not necessarily be imputed to or regarded as indicative of results for a full quarter or any future period. If the COVID-19 pandemic and related unfavorable economic conditions continue in certain regions, our new product innovation launches in those regions could be delayed.
In conclusion, I would like to summarize some recent positive points. One, currently, the companyâs flavor manufacturing facilities, its co-packers, warehouses and shipment facilities and bottlers and distributors are all operating. We are continually addressing our aluminum can requirements given our volume growth and the current supply constraints in the aluminum can industry. We are pleased with the new additions to the Monster Energy portfolio and are planning additional launches later in the year. Three, we are planning to continue additional launches of our Reign Total Body Fuel high-performance energy drinks in additional international countries. Four, we are pleased with the rollout of Predator and Fury and our affordable energy drink portfolio internationally. We are proceeding with plans to launch our affordable energy brands in a number of international countries during the year. Five, finally, please note that similar to last year in the light of the COVID-19 pandemic, we will conduct our annual stockholdersâ meeting exclusively as a viral meeting via live webcast. Additional information regarding attending the annual meeting, voting your shares and submitting questions can be found in the companyâs proxy statement.
Iâd like to open the floor to questions about the quarter. Thank you.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions] The first question is from Bonnie Herzog of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
Bonnie Herzog
Hi, everyone.
Hilton Schlosberg
Hi, Bonnie.
Bonnie Herzog
I wanted â hello. I wanted to ask you guys about the shortages of cans youâre experiencing. Could you give us a sense of how big of a driver that was of your gross margin contraction in the quarter? I mean was it the bulk of that, for instance? And Iâm curious to hear if the situation has deteriorated further in April and May? And then finally, when do you expect the shortage situation to improve or maybe stabilize? I mean, I guess, trying to understand if we all should assume this will be a pretty big issue for the remainder of the year? Thanks.
Rodney Sacks
Okay. So maybe I can get that, Bonnie. So what happened when we set our can requirements with our can companies about a year ago, we estimated that our sales would be 10% to 12% or up this year. In fact, as you can see, they are substantially above that. So whatever we contracted for, weâve got. What happened with our sales in January and February, ourselves were doing okay. And then in March, they have spiked up. And as Rodney quoted, in April, they are spiked up yet again. So what weâve done is weâve procured additional cans from South America and from Asia that will start coming in late in the second quarter. We also have new can companies that are opening their doors later this year, and we will be drawing cans from those companies as well. So to answer your question about the first quarter, yes, there was an impact. And the big impact, as we mentioned, in the release and on this call is that the bigger impact was these freight in costs where we were drawing product, for example, from Canada, and we were shipping product from various locations to our distribution center that impacted cost of sales. We also had â we broke our orbits. In other words, weâve always tried to manufacture and sell within regions to avoid excessive shipping costs. We had to break that this year to satisfy consumer demand and so that was another factor that impinged on the results. But the margin was impacted by â not only by those freight costs, but â excuse me, as we mentioned by the promotional allowances that were higher in the second quarter across the board. And also, from our geographical sales mix, because as you know, we sold a significantly higher percentage of product overseas than we did in the U.S. So itâs the same story that weâve experienced and weâve spoken to shareholders, the more we sell overseas, the lower is our gross margin percentage. But again, I must caution shareholders that we bank dollars, we donât bank gross profit percentages. And in taking the decisions we took in the first quarter, it was important to do so to satisfy demand. We knew the profitability would be higher, but the percentage may, in fact, be lower, which it was.
Operator
The next question is from Laurent Grandet of Guggenheim. Please go ahead.
Laurent Grandet
Yes. Good evening everyone. And actually, I want to dig a bit more in what youâre just saying in terms of gross margin. So you mentioned freight, so I understand thatâs the number one. The aluminum cans, you mentioned also, I mean, promotional activity. So if we were to put some numbers, itâs freight, 50% of the impact. I mean aluminum can and now maybe 30% and promotional activity, 20%. Iâd like to basically understand this a bit better. If you can, give us an idea here, that would be great? Thank you.
Hilton Schlosberg
So Laurent, we spoke about the first quarter. In the first quarter, the impact of the aluminum can costs were not a major factor. And as you know, and everyone else on the call probably knows as well that we have suffered significant and will set a significant increases in aluminum costs going forward. So for example, itâs no secret, but if you look back on a year ago, aluminum costs are up 83.6%, including the Midwest premium in the U.S., and they are up 71%, 71.1% in Europe. So as we go forward, we may not have some of the cost impacts on gross margin, but we certainly will have impacts on aluminum in the second and subsequent quarters. So for me to talk more about the first quarter, we donât actually give the numbers out that youâre asking for. But what I can say is that I donât expect the margins to improve going forward this year. I expect that we will not â that our margins will not improve as we go into the second, third. Possibly the fourth quarter, I think things will be better. Thatâs my analysis. But certainly in the second and third quarter, we will continue to suffer gross margin percentage in our stress gross margin percentage erosion.
Operator
The next question is from Chris Carey of Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.
Chris Carey
Hi everyone. 
Hilton Schlosberg
Hi, Chris.
Chris Carey
So obviously, a big â hey, so obviously, a big number quarter to-date. And I guess the question is, with the aluminum supply shortages that you have, are you going to run into some issues with the ability to fill that demand? And could that prevent you from doing some things that might help with your gross margin, which sounds like they could improve by Q4, like taking any pricing in the business?
Hilton Schlosberg
So thatâs obviously something that weâre very aware about on pricing. I know what some of our competitors, some of the big beverage companies have spoken about with regard to pricing. But Iâm not sure that we would take â move ourselves. Last time we went ahead and did it irrespective of Red Bullâs strategy with regard to pricing. They â I think this time around, weâre examining what they will be doing. Remember, they are importing a substantial amount of their cans and product from overseas. So we will be watching that. But there are other ways to take price up, for example, we can reassess, which we are doing, structure of promotional allowances to move margins in a more positive direction. But again, we donât want to disturb the business that is doing very well. Our share is â weâre happy with where the business is going. Weâre happy with our share, and we know when to disturb what we already have. So we bring in cans from abroad, as I said, weâre getting new cans in the system later on in the year. And as far as weâre concerned, we will continue to examine the opportunity to take price. And if necessary, as Iâve said, weâre looking at on our promotional allowances as well.

The next question is from Andrea Teixeira of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Andrea Teixeira
Hi, thank you, and good afternoon. On the True North Organic Energy launch, should we assume that the impact will be mostly concentrated in the second half, and particularly in 2022? And does that mean you have decided to remain in non-alcohol segment and youâre not launching a hard seltzer for now? And then hit on the gross margin, and I appreciate your commentary maybe perhaps we should assume that it may get worse before it gets better, given the freight and aluminum have actually been sequentially worse? Thank you.
Rodney Sacks
Perhaps Iâll take the part of it, and Hilton can take part of it. On True North, we are, as I indicated, we are going to have limited sales just going into and seeding the market this year. The full launch and rollout will take place early in â from the beginning or early in 2022. So it will â we think it will have an impact in 2022, and we will have much less of an impact this year.
Hilton Schlosberg
Okay. Andrea, you were talking about margins. As I said, I donât think margins will get better in the second and the third quarter, margin percentages, but with robust sales which is obviously something that weâre looking at in terms of our own forecasting, although we donât give guidance, we must look at the bottom line, and we must not necessarily look at percentages. Because what we have to do as part of our everyday function is to satisfy the demand of our customers because the last thing we want to do is to have our bottlers on the line without inventory, our consumers gravitating to other products. And we have to maintain the status quo. The company is doing really well on the top line. And we, hopefully, will continue to do so.
Rodney Sacks
Yes. Just â and then just to complete your question with regard to the alcoholic CELSIUS side. I donât think you can assume that we are going into it or not going into it. Donât make that assumption. Weâve addressed the nonalcoholic sell some market. Weâve decided a strategy, and weâve developed products. And align, and we are going to launch that line. As regards to alcoholic sensing, we are still looking at the market. I think if you have been watching the market, Iâm sure the analysts have been. I think youâve seen quite a lot of â a fortune of new products being launched, many â in cases from the same companies, just different variants. Throwing them against the wall and seeing whatâs going to stick. What youâve also seen in the last 3 months, what weâve noticed is quite a falloff in the rate of increase in the category. And as the category is maturing, so the increase is also tempering. So we are involved in looking at that category in developing products and as I think Iâve said in the last call, we simply donât want to launch a product. Thatâs me-too and that follows everyone else. Itâs just no point in that and taking the time and effort and detracting from our focus on our core energy brands and portfolio, where we get a better return and have, obviously, itâs much easier for us to get meaningful sales. But we are continuing to monitor the alcoholic energy seltzer category. And we may well do something in that. But how we do it and what we do it is still not being determined and still not â we donât have a firm direction. So, all I can really say is just that we are addressing it, but we shouldnât assume that we are definitely going to go ahead or definitely not going to go ahead or how.

The next question is from Mark Astrachan of Stifel. Please go ahead.
Mark Astrachan
Yes. Hey, thanks, and good afternoon everyone. I guess, donât kill me I am going to ask a bunch of it for follow-up questions here so helping restrain yourself for a second.
Hilton Schlosberg
Sure. 
Mark Astrachan
I guess on â are can shortages impacting your U.S. market share, if not, or if they are, could you maybe just talk about kind of what youâre seeing in the U.S. also, could you clarify on the gross margin youâre talking about relative to 1Q levels for 2Q and 3Q? Or are you talking about â youâre not giving us any sort of color on 2Q and 3Q relative to 1Q? And then back to the other question on pricing and then related to promotional allowances. So your capacity constrained, at least for the time being, whatâs the harm in taking price to constrain the demand and then also, youâre suggesting then the promotional allowances after 1Q will lessen in 2Q, 3Q kind of for the same effect?
Hilton Schlosberg
Okay. So where do you want me to start? So I think it is fair to say that out of stocks have impacted share. I donât know how big that impact is. And Iâm not going to because honestly, we donât know. But what we do know is that Red Bulls on-premise has moved into the measured channels. There is no question about that. I think we underestimated the impact of their on-premise business moving into major channels. However, our share is doing nicely. Our sales are growing very nicely. And frankly, we are selling everything that we can make. And what you guys are not seeing or not addressing is things like Amazon. We spoke about the Stackline data and our other unmeasured channels, for example, the Home Depots and the Loweâs and the home improvement stores and all those other parts of the business that are very strong for us are continuing to grow and continue to gain share in those particular channels. So overall, I think we are satisfied with where we are, as I said earlier. And weâre anticipating that as soon as we they can start coming to the U.S., and we start being in a more orderly situation that we will continue to grow again as we anticipate. So that was one question. Your second question was on margins. And I think I said that I expect my personal view, and this is not guidance, but I expect margins to get worse in the second and third quarter before they get better. So thatâs my answer to that. Mark, just remind me, what are your other questions?
Mark Astrachan
Pricing and promotional allowances relative to capacity constraints.
Hilton Schlosberg
Okay. I think pricing, I said to you, weâre continuing to evaluate. And weâre doing this on a honestly, on a daily basis. We would like Red Bull to lead, but if they donât lead, we will make a decision as to where we should or shouldnât go with regard to pricing. With regard to promotional allowances, that is correct. We will â we are putting back promotional allowances, and you should see â we should see some impact in future quarters.

Next question is from Dara Mohsenian of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Dara Mohsenian
Hey, guys. So just one quick clarity question and then one broader question, just â it does sound like there is a little bit of demand impact from the lack of full supply on the aluminum side. Are you expecting that to be a significant issue in Q2 before it gets better and you get some of this incremental supply in, just trying to understand that in the short-term? And then just a broader question, weâve obviously seen an acceleration in U.S. energy category growth the last few quarters after the initial weakness for a few months post-COVID. Can you just review what you think the key factors have been behind that acceleration in U.S. category growth? How sustainable they are going forward as we sort of look to that cycling that higher category growth in the back half of the year? Thanks.
Hilton Schlosberg
So maybe Iâll just take the first one, and then we will get Rodney to take the second one. So Dara, if you look at April sales, for example, and you take out â you strip out what happened in 2020. And you can see that there was a very big impact in sales in the second quarter and a very positive impact. So it is presenting challenges to the supply chain team, and we are doing everything we can to ensure that weâre able to keep as much as possible in stock. In fact, weâre focusing on the SKUs that are generating the significant part of our volumes at the expense of SKUs that are not performing as well. So thatâs really where weâre at with regard to the second quarter. We will be getting cans in. If these port issues resolve themselves, and we will â weâre trying as best as we can to get back in stock as soon as possible.
A - Rodney Sacksv
Yes. Just to â just add â just one thing. The uncertainty that weâve got is, obviously, for cans that weâre importing, we are also incurring freight costs above the aluminum cost or can price. So thatâs why those costs will go up the shorter term. As the additional plants in the U.S. come on stream, we will get back to a more normalized pricing structure for cans and get the additional volume. So itâs a little difficult now to predict exactly where weâre going to go on a month-to-month or quarter-to-quarter basis, but we think it will normalize, as Hilton said, towards the fourth quarter. With regard to the increased category, I think weâre already in a world of just unknowns. The category had a really steep hit rewards in late March, early April last year. Different in different parts of the world, when a lot of the bottlers literally took their staff and people teams out of the markets. But it has come back and the growth has come back really, really nicely. And so one of the things that we were â which were sort of unusual, we found that the growth was generally, historically has always been led by the convenience channel at a higher rate than the mainstream grocery and drug channels. And that sort of reversed itself with COVID. So again, youâre looking at factors that are just not normal. What we have seen, as you can see from the last 4 weeks numbers, we quoted in Nielsen from convenience, that started to pick up again quite nicely. So again, weâre in a very uncertain period because of what happened last year and your comps on last year. But even if you look at the 2-year stack sort of set of numbers, youâre getting some healthy growth back, where the category had slowed a little bit towards the end of â19, the growth was â they were still growing a bit slower. So we think that we will see continued growth regardless of how we come out of COVID and how our people come back into the markets. And we are hopeful for that. But again, itâs â we just canât predict that at this stage. Our numbers are good. The numbers are strong. And Red Bullâs numbers have been strong again, a little bit, we think, skewed by the switch from on-premise to off-premise, but continue to grow. And obviously, we are the main players in the category. And so, the category growth is driven by our â respectively, by our two brands respective sales. So I think it all goes well for us, but we just donât have any â I canât give you any further color on it because we would be guessing, I think we all are.
Tom Kelly
Yes. So the only thing I would add to that is that I always look at the first quarter of 2020 because that was kind of a pure quarter for us. COVID started kind of late in the quarter, where our sales were already in-house. And so the first quarter for us was really 2020 was really kind of a normal quarter. And if you look back to that first quarter, and I always do. First quarter net sales in 2020 over 2019 rose 12.3%. So even as we entered into COVID, our sales were strong.
