Operator
Welcome to the Broadcom Fourth Quarter 2014 Earnings Call. My name is Bakiba and I will be your operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions]. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I would now turn the call over to Peter Andrew. Peter Andrew, you may begin.
Peter Andrew
Thank you and good afternoon, everyone. Today's call will include prepared remarks by Scott McGregor, our President and Chief Executive Officer and Eric Brandt, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. This call will include forward-looking statements which are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause Broadcom's results to differ materially and adversely from management's current expectations.
We encourage you to review the cautionary statements and risk factors contained in the earnings release which was furnished with the SEC today and is available on our website and in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent reports on Form 10-Q. We undertake no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statement to reflect future events or circumstances. Additionally, throughout this call, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures.
Today's earnings and the related current report on Form 8-K describe the differences between our non-GAAP and GAAP reporting and present a reconciliation between the two for the periods reported in the release. Please also see the investor section of our website at Investors. Broadcom.com for a slide deck that includes additional information disclosed in accordance with SEC Regulation G. It is now my pleasure to introduce Broadcom's President and Chief Executive Officer, Scott McGregor.
Scott McGregor
Good afternoon and thanks for joining us. Broadcom had strong results in the December quarter. Revenue was at the high end of the guided range and non-GAAP EPS for the quarter came in ahead of first call at consensus. In the broadband and connectivity segment, revenues declined less than we initially expected. In broadband access, there is significant operator interest to upgrade last mile access technologies such as DSL and PON to the fastest speeds.
In set-top box, developed markets are upgrading to new media server architectures and we're starting to see the first ultra HD boxes roll out. The decline in connectivity was also more modest than we initially expected due to the success of new phone launches, as well as increasing penetration of 802.11ac and 2x2 solutions. In infrastructure, our business declined as expected due to lower data center and service provider spending.
For 2014, we delivered record revenues and record reportable segment profitability. Our BCG and ING revenue grew 6% while operating profit grew 25%, consistent with our goal of profitable growth. I'll go into these items in more detail later in the call, but first, I'll turn the call over to Eric for details on the fourth quarter results and on first quarter guidance.
Eric Brandt
Thanks, Scott. As Peter mentioned, please refer to the data breakout on the investor section of our website for additional information that will supplement my financial commentary. As previously discussed at our analyst day, we're now including stock-based compensation in our non-GAAP operating results, in addition to allocating it to our reportable segments. We decided to make this change to recognize-reflect all employee costs in our results and align with many investors' financial models.
Consistent with this, weâve recast our segments and other non-GAAP financial information in our 10-K and web financial statements for the current and prior periods. For the purposes of comparability with external estimates and prior guidance, we're also providing the comparable non-GAAP metrics excluding stock-based compensation in the following discussion. Going forward, we will guide gross margin and R&D and SG&A expenses that include stock-based compensation.
Moving to the financial overview. To summarize, Q4 revenue came in at $2.14 billion, down 5.2% sequentially and up 3.8% year-over-year. Excluding cellular base band revenue, reportable segment revenue was down 3% sequentially and up 10% year-over-year. Q4 non-GAAP gross margin was up 60 basis points from Q3 to 54.7%. Our Q4 non-GAAP gross margin now includes roughly 30 basis points of stock-based compensation.
Q4 GAAP gross margin was 52.8%. Q4 R&D plus SG&A expenses were down $46 million, including stock-based compensation. Q4 non-GAAP EPS, excluding stock-based compensation, was $0.90 a share or $0.03 above first call consensus of $0.87 per share. Including stock-based compensation, Q4 non-GAAP EPS was $0.76 a share. Q4 GAAP EPS was $0.64 a share which includes $0.09 of additional impairment and restructuring charges principally related to our exit of the cellular base band business. Cash flow from operations for Q4 was $633 million. Our cash and marketable securities balance at the end of the quarter was $6 billion.
Moving to revenue and gross margin. In December, we updated our guided range for Q4 revenue to between $2.075 billion and $2.15 billion. We delivered revenue right at the high end of that range at $2.143 billion. Our broadband and connectivity revenue came in ahead of expectations at $1.48 billion, down roughly 2% sequentially. Upside in the quarter was in wireless connectivity and broadband modems.
Revenue from our infrastructure and networking segment met our expectations of down sequentially at $625 million. Q4 non-GAAP gross margin was up 60 basis points from Q3 to 54.7% and includes roughly 30 basis points of stock-based compensation. This was at the midpoint of our guided range of 55% excluding stock-based compensation. Q4 GAAP gross margin was up from Q3 to 52.8%.
Moving to operating expenses. Total R&D and SG&A expenses were slightly above our revised guidance in December and down $46 million from Q3 levels, including stock-based compensation as a couple of unplanned tape-outs occurred late in the quarter. Going forward, non-GAAP and GAAP R&D plus SG&A should be the same and will be consolidated into a single estimate.
Moving to the balance sheet. Cash and marketable securities ended Q4 at $6 billion of which 48% is in the U.S.. Cash flow from operations was $633 million. During the quarter, we paid $72 million in dividends and repurchased 2.5 million shares of stock at a cost of $104 million. We announced an increase in our quarterly dividend by 17% to $0.14 per share. We also continue to target repurchasing $1 billion of stock in 2015, Q4 accounts receivable day sales outstanding were 34 days and net inventory turns were 7.6.
Moving to restructuring and impairment charges. In Q4, we recorded restructuring costs of $16 million and impairment charges of $14 million, as we continued to exit our wind down of our cellular base band business. We expect to record an additional $40 million of restructuring charges over the next 12 months primarily related to the closing or consolidation of 19 locations.
Moving to expectations, We currently expect net revenue in Q1 to be $2 billion plus or minus $75 million. From a segment perspective, we expect broadband and connectivity to be down and infrastructure networking to be roughly flat. We expect Q1 non-GAAP gross margin to be roughly flat to Q4 at 54.7% plus or minus 75 basis points and GAAP gross margin to be flat as well at 52.8% plus or minus 75 basis points.
We expect R&D and SG&A expenses in Q1 to be up between $5 million and $25 million which, again, now includes stock-based compensation.
And now I would like to turn the call back over to Scott to talk more about the state of the business.
Scott McGregor
Thanks, Eric. Starting with the broadband and connectivity business, our revenue came in at $1.475 billion down roughly 2% sequentially and better than we initially expected. Upside in the quarter was across the board, including set-top box, broadband access and particularly wireless connectivity. In set-top box, we're seeing growth in emerging markets and new technologies. Operators such as Dish in North America, Free in France and Tata in India have begun to offer ultra HD set-top boxes to their subscribers.
We're expecting at least 15 operators across multiple regions to launch 4K television service in 2015. In broadband access, the race to Gigabit speeds in the home continues as telcos invest in G.fast and cable MSOs invest in DOCSIS 3.1, while both invest in high speed optical access. Broadcom is leading this transition with our first design wins with G.fast and 10-GPON already in place.
In connectivity, we saw increased demand for newly introduced smartphones, combined with increasing adoption of new wireless technologies such as 802.11ac and 2x2 solutions that drive higher ASPs. 5G WiFi revenues reached a record high in the quarter and more than doubled for the year. We're seeing significant customer interest in our 4x4 multiuser MIMO 5G WiFi chip targeted for retail routers, broadband access gateways and set-top boxes. In addition, we're broadening our connectivity business beyond smartphones into adjacent markets, for example, we're powering both Denon and Harman Kardon's WiFi home audio systems.
We've also received our first design win for our wireless charging solution. We continue to diversify into new markets such as Internet of Things, automotive, wearables and small cells. In the Internet of Things market, design activity remains high with our current products and we're in the process of refreshing our portfolio with purposeful products that are optimized specifically for different market segments. Registrations for our WICED Internet of Things platform have grown dramatically from 2000 at the beginning of 2014 to over 8000 now.
We announced the expansion of our distribution channel with more than 40 new partners to expand our sales reach to Internet of Things customers. Lastly, small cell remains an emerging opportunity. We're ramping our newly launched LTE and TD-SCDMA solutions while maintaining our market-leading position in 3G. We're starting to see increasing adoption from carriers. For example, we're working with SpiderCloud, who recently announced they will be supplying Verizon for 4G enterprise small cells. Looking into Q1, we expect our broadband and connectivity business to be down sequentially.
Moving to infrastructure. Our infrastructure and networking group declined as expected, down 4% sequentially to $625 million. The data center segment was relatively stronger than the enterprise and service provider segments. In the data center market, we have a large number of customers in production with Trident II and are building a solid pipeline of design wins for Tomahawk. At 3.2 terabits per second, Tomahawk is the industry's highest bandwidth switching solution and has been shipped to over 15 different networking box makers, establishing an early lead over competitors. Longer term, we remain confident in growth drivers that include new build-outs and expansions of data centers, increasing data traffic at faster speeds and ASIC conversions to merchant solutions. In the service provider market, we're seeing broad adoption of our 28-nanometer heterogeneous knowledge-based processers.
We also delivered version 2.0 of our OpenFlow SDN or software defined networking reference platform that delivers on the flexibility and control requirements for large scale carrier network deployments. Finally, we released an enhanced version of our broader reach Ethernet product that extends our automotive market opportunity beyond infotainment and driver assistance into telematics, satellite antennas and instrumentation clusters. We currently have design wins with five automakers and expect solid growth this year.
As we look into Q1, we expect our infrastructure and networking business to be roughly flat sequentially. In summary, our broadband and connectivity and our infrastructure and networking segments performed well during the fourth quarter and we exceeded our expectations for both revenue and operating profits. 2014 has been the third consecutive year of double-digit growth for our infrastructure and networking business due to our leadership in the switch market.
Broadband and connectivity saw single digit growth in 2014 due to a strong position in the high end of the phone market and set-top box and access markets.
This concludes our prepared comments and we're now ready for your questions. Bakiba, may we have the first question, please?
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions]. Our first question is going to come from Vivek Arya out of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead with your question.
Vivek Arya
Thank you for taking my question and good execution on the cash generation side in Q4. When I look at the Q1 outlook implied for the broadband and connectivity segment, it shows sales down about 8%. Not that far off from the down 6%, 7% in prior years. Do you think, Scott, this business is back to seasonal trends, IE, the connectivity part has stabilized? Or do you still think there are some shoes to sort of drop on the connectivity side that could take somewhat longer to get back to more seasonal trends?
Scott McGregor
I think our connectivity business is strong. We've had very good strength in the high end of the market, continue to do so. We've been able to migrate our customers to higher end solutions, including 802.11 AC and moving towards 2x2. Not all of our customers have moved to 2x2, so there's some opportunity to move there and we see other technologies becoming available as well. We're also broadening our technology portfolio in connectivity to include things like wireless charging and other technologies. So we see that business over the long term. I think this year will be potentially a little challenging.
But over the long term, we see that as a growth business. In terms of seasonality, a little hard to predict there because it tends to be affected by the inventory and the consumption of some of our larger customers, but again, that's a real good busy think going forward.
Vivek Arya
And then as my follow-up on the infrastructure and networking business, it has been doing well for a long period of time. But when I look at Q4 and Q1, the implied growth rate is about 5% to 6% year-on-year. I think you had mentioned some good trends on the data center side, but slowdown on the carrier side. When do you see that business get back to your target, sort of double-digit growth rates? And what's going to be the catalyst? Is it new products? Does China LTE spending need to turn back up? When will we start to see your traditional growth trajectory in that business? Thank you.
Scott McGregor
Our infrastructure business is driven by a number of factors, they include certainly capital spending on the part of the larger carriers, it includes the build-outs of large data centers and then the overall enterprise upgrade as people move to higher speeds. We also introduced a number of new products and continue to push forward there. So all of those are the factors that drive growth and many of those, we don't control. But over the longer term, we do see that as a double-digit business and when it works out to exactly this year will again depend on those factors and it's hard for us to predict, but certainly we see that as a double-digit growth business over a multiple year period.
Vivek Arya
One quick one for Eric. In Q4, the buyback I believe was about 100 million, but I think you allocated 1 billion to this year. Should we expect that to be stretched out evenly across all the quarters or more frontend or backend loaded? Thank you.
Eric Brandt
I would say it really does depend on the stock price, but I would say our intention is to be more or less evenly distributed across the quarters, maybe a little bit more front end dependent. Depends on how the market's behaving.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is going to come from Harlan Sur out of JPMorgan. Please go ahead with your question.
Harlan Sur
Within broadband and connectivity and specifically I'm more focused on broadband, on the Q1 guide is this primarily seasonal declines? And then as you think primarily about 2015, what's the confidence level about driving growth in the broadband segment? And maybe some color on what products and end markets are going to be driving that growth. Is it going to be more set top box driven or more broadband access driven?
Eric Brandt
So Harlan, it's Eric. I'll answer the seasonality piece. Relative to broadband in Q4, it was actually a touch better than seasonal in Q4, on the strength of some key product launches in Q4 and while well within the standard deviation, a touch below the seasonal number in Q1. So you know, probably net pretty close together, but that's sort of the rough seasonal -- pretty close to seasonal when you look sort of at both quarters together.
Scott McGregor
Harlan, in terms of growth drivers, we've been benefiting from geographic expansion. We've talked about expanding into South America, into South Asia, into Africa, places like that that have been relatively new territories for us. So that's benefited us certainly in 2014 and I see that continuing into the next year. As we get further into the year, we'll see more of a pickup from the 4K HEVC opportunity. That's a multiyear kind of opportunity over the next 3 or 4 years, as I think a lot of, a lot of the MSOs and so forth will move to 4K and also on things like cable modem, we're seeing people move to DOCSIS 3.1. I think we'll see initial shipments this year, but that's more of a 2016 phenomenon when we'll see DOCSIS 3.1 start to real kick in. So we've got a set of growth drivers there and obviously we'll continue to broaden that portfolio and we have got some other businesses there including small cells and internet of things and other stuff that will drive that as well
Harlan Surveillance
Just a follow-up question for Eric on the OpEx front. And I'm certainly not complaining here. If you can help us understand what's driving the lower step-up in OpEx in Q1? Typically it's a $30 million to $40 million step-up. You're guiding it to grow only $15 million. And I think at analyst day you expected OpEx beyond Q1 to step up a little bit in Q2 due to more employee-related benefits and then kind of trend down Q3 and Q4. Is that how we should continue to think about it as well?
Scott McGregor
So on the first point, Harlan, you're correct. The step-up in Q1 historically has been about $30 million to $35 million with the reduction in the number of people associated with our exit from the cellular base band. That number looks more like 25-ish million dollars. There is actually a pretty strong quarter in masks and prototyping costs as well, offset by solid expense management in Q1 and other areas. So that's why you see the lower number relative to what you would expect from the step-up. We continue to manage our expenses pretty tightly and going into Q1 we'll continue to do so.
As you look across the rest of the year, bear in mind that Q1 really has only one month of the merit increase in the number, given the timing of when the merit increase is distributed. So you pick up the other two months in Q2, so typically it's up a little bit in Q2 as a result of that, just by itself. And then you're right, probably flat to down in the remaining quarters of the year as the fringe comes down and we sort of manage our costs pretty tightly. The only plus or minus could be just timing of tape-outs.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is going to come from Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead with your question.
Ross Seymore
Eric, this one's for you. On gross margin, can you talk a little bit about the puts and takes on why that would be flat in the first quarter? I would think from a mix-adjusted perspective, it would have risen. If there is any other detail you can provide there, I would appreciate it.
Eric Brandt
Sure, Ross. It's a good question. There are two things going on in Q1 in terms of the guide. One is that there is some mix within mix, but actually, the gross margin would actually be up slightly in Q1 but for the absorption difference between Q4 and Q1 on the lower revenue. And that's about a 25 basis point impact. So if you use the same revenue or cost to quarters, we would be looking up 25 basis points.
Ross Seymore
So this is a utilization or a coverage issue, that mix isn't enough to offset that, I think?
Eric Brandt
Well, no. Well that's what's making it flat. It would otherwise be up, so there's some benefit actually that would go into Q1 if you had the same revenue. And there's some mix within mix just on timing of things, but otherwise, actually it's slightly up in Q1 if the revenue were the same.
Ross Seymore
This is my follow-up, sticking on the expense side of the equation. I'm happy you guys are putting stock-base comp now into the numbers. I think it's a good higher quality number for us to look at. Can you talk a little bit about what you expect stock-based comp to do throughout this year and maybe as 2015 as a whole?
Eric Brandt
Sure. So I expect in Q1 SBC, stock-based comp to be down a couple of million bucks Q4 to Q1 and then roughly flat plus or minus a couple of things over the course of the year for the rest of the year. So the pattern that we've had in the past, as we sort of move to our adjustment in stock-base comp, some of the changes again with less employees in the company, we should see a relatively flat stock-based comp number per quarter across the year.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is going to come from Srini Pajjuri from CLSA Securities. Please go ahead with your question.
Srini Pajjuri
Scott, on the connectivity side, can you talk about how you're feeling about your market share on the high end and also now that most of the 802.11 AC transition is done, what's going to drive the growth in this business as you look out to next one to two years?
Scott McGregor
So I would characterize our market share in the high end of connectivity as very strong. We believe we're winning and hopefully will continue to win the majority of those designs based on very strong product execution. In terms of what drives revenue growth in that area going forward, it's true that many of the customers have now moved to 802.11 AC, but we see increasing numbers of diversity, antennas go in those boxes. They will move from 1x1 to 2x2 and even over that over time. Typically what you see in tablets or in laptops moves into cell phones as people look for higher connectivity performance. Also driving growth is the opportunity to add additional technologies. So for us it's an opportunity to grow share in NFC, wireless charging and other technologies that I think will be able to contribute meaningfully going forward.
Srini Pajjuri
And then just a quick follow-up. You also mentioned that you had the first design win in wireless charging. Just to clarify is that in the smartphone product? And also how should we think about the opportunity there? Are you primarily targeting smartphones? Is the market bigger than that? When should we expect meaningful revenues from this product? Thank you.
Scott McGregor
I can't share the nature of our design win there, but I mean, we expect it could be one of many going forward. We're targeting everything from smartphones to a variety of Internet of Things devices. I'm a big fan of wireless charging. It's not just a convenience for the customer, but as many people are trying to create either a form factor change where they eliminate a lot of the USB connectors and things like that that today are problematic both from a form factor point of view, but also from a water intrusion point of view. A lot of medical devices, even smartphones now are being characterized as water-resistant to significant depth and so feeling those hermetically is important and so replacing all the wires including the power connections is very important.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is going to come from Stacy Rasgon from Bernstein. Please go ahead with your question.
Stacy Rasgon
Question about OpEx growth going forward. You said at Analyst Day you thought your sort of normalized cost-based growth should be 4% a year give or take. Is that still the right number we should be thinking about? If that's true, how should we be thinking about leverage in the model going forward, particularly if you start run more sustainably at the high end or even your current margin target?
Scott McGregor
Stacy, you're correct. I did manage that at Analyst Day. Actually, as it turns out, we've done better than that in 2014 and our hope is to continue to do better than that in 2015 because we have an initiative to try to make sure that we're managing our cost inflation down, like many other businesses do, despite the fact that the R&D costs in this industry are drifting up. To the extent the growth rate is above that number, you should expect that there will be an opportunity to drive leverage through the P&L.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is going to come from John Pitzer from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead with your question.
John Pitzer
Scott, I guess my first question, I know you don't break out connectivity specifically, but is that business kind of back on a growth path year-over-year? And if you can help me understand how much of that business now is outside the handset business and kind of what the prospect is there and then as my follow-up, FCC changed the technical definition of broadband today. I appreciate that it's early and it will be a knee-jerk reaction, but what do you think the implications might be for your last mile business with this change in definition?
Scott McGregor
So in terms of your question, we do break out connectivity, so you can see some of that. We'll file our K very shortly here. So you'll have the opportunity to see that. In terms of that being a growth business this year, I think it will be challenging, not impossible, but it will be challenging this year, simply because of some of the headwinds of exiting the base band business, but longer term, we do see that as a growth business. In terms of the FCC thing, I haven't seen that yet, so can't comment.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is going to come from Timothy Arcuri from Cowen & Company. Please go ahead with your question.
Timothy Arcuri
First of all, Scott, I'm wondering if you can update us on the connectivity buckets. You said when you exited base band, you talked about that mid to low end bucket being 500 million to 800 million. I think you said that it's not going away as rapidly as you thought. So I'm wondering if maybe you could update us on that and maybe what size that bucket might be in, you know, 2015. And then a question for Eric. I just want to make sure that the incremental cash flow in 2015, is it fair to assume that it's going to be about 40% onshore and roughly 60% offshore? Thanks.
Scott McGregor
So in terms of your connectivity question, we gave a snapshot at the time we exited the cellular base band business and we said that we felt roughly 100 million was at risk due to simply attach rate on our cellular base band business and it would depend who picked up that business, whether we would keep the connectivity or not. And we said that there was a 500 to 800 total size of the business if we lost all of those small and midrange business. So that's sort of a theoretical maximum on that.
I'm not going to update the size of the bucket or where we're on that going forward, but let me try to help you a little bit here. We have seen fortunately a lot of the base band business that we did lose did go to people, partners who are friendly with us. So we kept some of that connectivity. We're also seeing the connectivity business is doing fairly well actually and so with some of the base band share shifts that are going on and that we expect to go on over the next couple of years, we think that business is far stronger than certainly any worse case projection and probably better than most of the sort of typical projections we would have seen. So very good situation in the connectivity and I see that as continuing and I believe that will turn into a growth business for us over the course of the next couple years.
Eric Brandt
And Tim, it's Eric. Just to answer your question on cash flow, consistent with our plan to put in place the tax strategy this year, we see the U.S. cash flow moving up from in the range of 30% to 40% to 45% of the total cash flow this year.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is going to come from Mark Delaney from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question.
Mark Delaney
I was hoping you could elaborate a little bit more on some of the trends that youâre seeing within your infrastructure business. I think, Scott, you mentioned in your prepared remarks that maybe the data center business was doing a little bit better than the other buckets within infrastructure. And obviously there has been some widely publicized weakness in the K or CapEx service provider piece of the, that end market. Can you just talk about how much confidence or if you have visibility that that carrier CapEx exposed piece is starting to bottom here in 1Q and if you start to see growth in that piece of the infrastructure segment as we move through 2015?
Scott McGregor
Yes, certainly stuff that we track. Unfortunately, we don't have a crystal ball to project the carrier OpEx or carrier capital spend that drives a lot of that business. So we're certainly tracking that there. Our goal obviously is to get a higher percentage of the CapEx over time with broadening our product family and getting into more customers and we do see the opportunity to expand our customer base a bit. We're in most of those customers today, but we can still get at customers or broaden our footprint within them, so an opportunity there.
We've definitely seen the data center as the larger driver of the growth recently and based on the CapEx forecast I've seen, that's probably going to be certainly true in the near term. We do believe that some of the service providers, especially outside the United States are going to increase their CapEx over the course of the year and in the years to come. So there is an opportunity there. But you know, probably hard for us to predict there. You're probably better off getting that data from them. We would be more reactive to that rather than able to forecast that.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is going to come from C.J. Muse from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
C.J. Muse
I guess two quick questions. Scott, first one, is there a scenario where you could see broadband and connectivity flatter or grow in 2015? And if so, what are the key underlying assumptions we have to make there? And quick question for Eric. How should we think about strengthening dollar impacting your business, if at all? Thank you.
Eric Brandt
I think the growth case for broadband and connectivity depends on how well some of our customers do and what the sell-through is for devices like high end smartphones, where we have a very strong share. In the broadband space certainly influenced by how aggressively the various telcos and MSOs roll out things like 4K and really try and up the bandwidth. So that's going to be more CapEx dependent based on those companies, whereas it's a little more consumer dependent on the smartphones and other devices there.
I think Internet of Things is going to be an important driver going forward. A little hard to predict this year. We're seeing some interesting devices come out. The watch business is an interesting business. Hard to forecast, but certainly there are some people out there who see high forecasts in that and I think we would certainly get a piece of that. We're in most of the watches that have been shipped to date and we believe we can see some position in that market, but going forward there will be different kinds of growth drivers involved and we'll just have to see how the year develops.
Scott McGregor
And CJ, on the currency thing, fortunately for us on the P&L currency has an immaterial impact to our P&L. We don't really have any sort of -- anything that sort of moves it a whole lot since we transact most of what we do in U.S. dollars and really our only foreign exposure which is somewhat beneficial is actually the cost of our employees overseas. Now when you read the 10-K which will be published today, you'll see an OCI number and that's really sort of the balance sheet movement of currency in places like goodwill. But again, it doesn't really impact the P&L. We're fortunate that it's an immaterial impact to our P&L.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is going to come from Doug Freeman from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead with your question.
Doug Freeman
When I look, though at what's happening out in the marketplace, last night we heard from one of your old base band competitors that they are struggling to win some feature phone business out there. Can you maybe talk if how we should think about what's going on at some of your larger customers and maybe the ramp-up and ramp-down of new projects and whether we should think that that will impact your connectivity business?
Scott McGregor
Our connectivity business has the fortunate situation of being fairly distributed over all of the larger customers and over most of the models of those customers. And so we're relatively insulated from the ramp-up or ramp-down of particular models. Obviously, if one customer were to have tremendous success with a model that often is good for us. But share shift and ramping up models inside a customer don't have as big an impact on us because again, of that strong market share and breadth of position across the different customers.
Eric Brandt
I would just add to that, that to the extent that there are shifts in base band share towards solutions which would be more aligned with our connectivity will benefit from that.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is going to come from Craig Ellis from B. Riley. Please go ahead.
Craig Ellis
Scott, I appreciate all the detail on the segment opportunities as you look out over the year. I'm wondering if you can take that to a higher level as you look across the segments. What are the key drivers for Broadcom for calendar year '15?
Scott McGregor
Well it's always a little hard to predict, even for us. I mean, we have some view of the different customers, but we continue to see data center as an opportunity and build-outs there. We see in broadband the geographic expansion that we've seen over the recent quarters continuing. Connectivity, we've got opportunities for new technologies and things like NFC, things like wireless charging. I think those are opportunities for us, you know towards the latter part of this year, getting some growth there.
So it will depend. We'll have to see. You know as we get further into the year or into next year, certainly things like DOCSIS 3.1 and the HEVC 4K technologies are big players there. We'll drive all of these different things. We also have other opportunities. Automotive still is relatively small for us, but it's a pretty good, solid, steady grower. And so over the next few years, we expect that will become increasingly material to our results and a very good business there. It's a very broad-based portfolio. I think in the past, Broadcom was sort of dependent on one or two things for growth and going forward here we see quite a diversity of opportunities for growth and gives us a more balanced and diverse opportunity to have growth.
Craig Ellis
And the follow-up is somewhat related to the way you finished that. In years past at this point, the company would often cite base band as the priority for incremental R&D. However, this is the first year in a long time where the company has quite a bit of flexibility in terms of where it spends relative to years past. So how do we think about the top candidates for incremental R&D across the portfolio this year?
Scott McGregor
We certainly think of it as a portfolio basis and we look at balancing R&D and putting it where it has the most benefit. I mean, what's really I think a blessing at this point is that the ban for the buck of relatively smaller R&D investments is definitely there. One of the challenges with base band is it was just a very large monolithic block of investments that cast a shadow over other things and we're now able to find a lot of projects where 10 or 30 engineers make a huge difference as opposed to thousands of engineers like we had in the base band space. I'm not going to share with you where we're putting our R&D bets, that's pretty confidential for us. But rest assured that we're seeing plenty of opportunity and I think the opportunities again are much more tangible and we see a more certain return on those which makes me pretty optimistic about over the next few years we should get an increase in the effectiveness of our R&D.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is going to come from Blayne Curtis from Barclays. Please go ahead with your question.
Blayne Curtis
I just want to follow up, Scott, on the 4K opportunity. The Cable MSOs have been slow to roll out in technology, it seems like over the top is -- maybe you can accelerate that. Just curious your views on how this actually rolls out. Is the time line potentially faster now that you have some of the over-the-top stuff rolling it out today?
Scott McGregor
I think 4K is going to be something that is driven by a couple things. I think the consumers definitely want it and a lot of people buying certainly at the high end TV sets today, are going to buy 4K sets just to future-proof their living room or family room. I think the over-the-top guys have an opportunity to be fairly quick, but I believe the satellite guys, the cable guys, the telcos, they are all going to go on this pretty fast. And so the challenge is going to be more on the content side I think rather than the true technology side, because you only want to watch the nature show reruns so many times. I think sports is going to be a key driver of content and then the movies I think are largely being shot in 4K today for a lot of the new movies. So you'll see that. It's amazing, the opportunities to create that. I mean you can buy 4K drones today, a very, very of quality. So the opportunity to create content I think is going up and once the content starts catching up, I think that's going to be where it will kick over and you'll see wide scale adoption. So consumers will be willing to pay incremental fees in order to get access to good quality 4K content.

Thank you. Our next question is going to come from David Wong from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead with your question. Go ahead, David. Your line is open.
David Wong
What do you reckon the growth potential for your broadband and connectivity business is?
Scott McGregor
The growth potential. Well, I think over the longer run, over the next few years we see that as a growth business. We don't characterize exactly what percentage of growth, but I see that as a business that can definitely be very material growth for us.
David Wong
And within Internet of Things, are there any particular applications or chip capabilities you're focusing your investments on?
Scott McGregor
Well, we're focused on many different things. We have such very broad portfolio. So I'm a little reluctant to tell you where we're spending our R&D there, but we definitely have a lot of opportunities.
Operator
Okay. Thank you. Our next question is going to come from Christopher Roland from FBR Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Christopher Roland
If you guys could talk briefly about 60 gigahertz WiFi, I thought your demos at CES were pretty compelling. Do you see this as the next generation of WiFi or is it really something different? And how might the market dynamics be different than what we saw in .ac?
Scott McGregor
60 gigahertz is an interesting technology because of its high frequency, the opportunity to have very high bandwidth, yet it also has some challenges such it tends to be a little more line of sight or rely on scatter and reflection. So for example, it's blocked by the human body, it's blocked by a table or furniture and so it makes it difficult to use in many cases. I think you're going to see the use cases are a number. I think you'll see some cable replacement where you'll replace short range cable connections, you know, like a high-speed USB kind of connection. I think you'll see it for high-speed data backup or connectivity where you can assure a line of sight. So those will be opportunities for it there. I don't think it will replace wireless LAN. Wireless LAN has an incredible range. We've gotten the range of wireless LAN up well over the initial 100 meter spec to 2 or 3 times that and the data rate is very high on wireless LAN these days. So I think 60 gigahertz will tend to be specialized applications, certainly not a replacement for wireless LAN and I wouldn't be surprised if you'll see devices have both in them.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is going to come from Hans Mosesmann from Raymond James. Please go ahead with your question.
Hans Mosesmann
Scott, can you give us an update on your [inaudible] multi-core processor, you didn't mention anything in your prepared remarks, but if there is an effort tell us the strategic importance of it or maybe you don't have to be in business, maybe you can give us your comments. Thanks.
Scott McGregor
Broadcom has a broad range of ARM processers that we do internally. We have ARM processers in quite a few of our devices actually and many of them are multiprocessor. So for example, our set-top boxes have very, very strong multiprocessor ARM cores in them. We also see an opportunity in the network space for network processers and we've made a good effort there and we've announced a processor architecture which is definitely super-high performance there that competes with the highest performance processers you can get anywhere. And again, the challenge with multiprocessors is not just the speed of the processor itself, but the overall system performance because you have to balance the buses for the data and the instructions and the I/O on those devices.
So we'll look to scaling that up at the very high end in our infrastructure and networking space, as well as deploy it through broadband and things like set-top boxes where you run it for applications and then also in things like Internet of Things. We have ARM processers there where we use them for running the applications. Those tend to be very low power, very small footprint devices. So we have probably almost two orders of magnitude in size of these ARM cores that we use across our whole product family.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is going to come from Ruben Roy from Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.
Ruben Roy
Scott, I just had a quick one on one of your comments, the 2x2 WiFi. You said you doubled the revenue in 2014, I believe. I'm wondering in terms of the mix of design activity that you're seeing there, how far along are you in smartphones and are those products also bleeding into some other end markets? And if you could talk a little bit about if there is a margin implication there. Is it a positive margin implication as you move 2x2? Thanks.
Scott McGregor
Yes, I can't give you color to the extent of specific customers, but we're definitely seeing sort of the move from 1x1 to 2x2 and weâre going to see some customers go to 3x3 or other kind of things. There is definitely an opportunity to keep upping the performance of wireless LAN, whether it's AC in different configurations or a new AX technology going forward that has an opportunity for much better performance in crowded environments and other things.
So I think that for many, many years, we see lots of opportunity to increase margin or increase competitiveness by adding additional technologies and combining them. And then of course one of the things that Broadcom is especially good at is making all of these technologies play well together. So it's one thing to have a great technology here, but it's another thing to make it work well with all the other radio technologies you have in the product and that's a specialty of ours and works especially well in our combo chips. And so you'll see us broaden our combo chips to include new technologies and more advanced technologies going forward and to your point, does that help on margin, yes it does to the extent we can fill new technologies there.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is going to come from Quinn Bolton from Needham & Company. Please go ahead with your question.
Quinn Bolton
One for Scott, one for Eric. Scott, just wanted to know, a number of your competitors in the switch space have announced Tomahawk class switches, some of which are programmable. Just wondering if you're seeing any real change in the competitive landscape at the high end of the data center switch market. And then for Eric, you talked about increasing at Analyst Day, increasing U.S. cash flow from 30% to 40% to 45% as you adjust the tax. Is there a new tax guidance you can give us for 2015? Or are you still working through taxes? Thanks.
Scott McGregor
I think in the high end switch, what you've seen from Broadcom is taking a series of high end switches that we did in a single family, the Trident family and now really broadening it into multiple families of high end switches. So you see parallel product families of Tomahawk and Trident and then all of the other switches we do below that, the whole XGS family. So we've got a tremendous family there and the nice thing is there is great software compatibility across those and some of our competitors like to position theirs as potentially programmable and ours not.
Our switches are all programmable and customizable. So that's a misimpression that some people have gotten. We haven't seen much competition on the high end and we have certainly seen announcements, but to my knowledge, they haven't sampled yet. So our experience is generally from the time you actually sample and get it in a customer's hands, it's a year or 18 months before you see shipment revenue on that. And I mentioned in my earlier remarks we have something like 15 different customers who are building products based on Tomahawk today. So very, very different I think view of the competitors versus where we're in that space and Broadcom has executed extremely well there.
Eric Brandt
Quinn, it's Eric. I believe I mentioned on analyst day, you should presume that the tax rate moves up by roughly 1 point this year. That's about it.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is going to come from Joe Moore from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question.
Joe Moore
You talked at Analyst Day about a number of initiatives to sort of realign management compensation and doing things like charging at the segment levels, the stock option expense, things like that. Just wondering what changes you think now that you've sort of gone back to the [Technical Difficulty] is that going to result in lower stock issuance over time from stock comp expense? And just any other changes that you see as you've started to implement those changes.
Eric Brandt
Joe, it's Eric. Look, I think we view stock-based compensation as part of our employee-base costs. We mention that we're looking at the balance between cash and equity and I think what you'll see when we publish that, we will publish a lower number than what you saw last year by the amount that we were talking about on Analyst Day. We're targeting the number to be sub-4%. We think there's an opportunity to do that and do that relatively quickly.

Thank you Our next question is going to come from Suji De Silva from Topeka Capital Markets. Please go ahead with your question. 
Suji De Silva
Question about the enterprise data center business, I presume the strength there is coming from corporate as well as some of the cloud customers, you have a very strong position with. I'm wondering if there is potential for that business to be lumpy as it continues to ramp up in 2015 or whether you expect a more steady track there?
Scott McGregor
Well, it's always somewhat lumpy. I think the data center business is driven increasingly by these large cloud data centers that are being deployed. You see there is like 10 companies that are driving a huge percentage of all the data center expansion. And we also see a lot of the corporate guys either outsourcing to guys like that or when they build a new data center, they build it more in a cloud architecture sort of an in-sourced cloud, if you will. So definitely some lumpiness, but we do see that as a strong trend for us going forward.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is going to come from [inaudible] from MacQuarie. Please go ahead with your question.
Unidentified Analyst
I had a question for Scott about the content wearables. It sound like you're getting good design traction there. So should we think about content in that market segment similar to that as feature phones, smartphones or tablets? And then Eric, on the segment operating model, on the new disclosure it kind of looks like the networking business has similar operating margins to broadband. So as we think about OpEx growth on a segment level going forward and subsequently how should we think about operating leverage?
Scott McGregor
The content and wearables, it really depends on exactly what we win in the device, but generally, the connectivity is simpler, it's lower power, it's smaller footprint, so generally tends to have a lower ASP than in the -- certainly the high end smartphones that we've seen.
Eric Brandt
And then on the question on the segment operating margins, I mean, if you look at the year what you'll see in the K, actually they are not the same. The infrastructure business with stock-based comp will be about 27% and the broadband business about 20%. So they are still structurally different in terms of their operating margins in terms of the businesses. And then I would say in terms of operating expense deployment literally it's a project by project and ROI by ROI opportunity basis. I don't know that we think specifically about the businesses, although we're trying to manage both of those businesses to a set of targets relative to operating margin which would determine the amount of R&D that they would be allocated or incremental R&D they would be allocated based on their ability to hit that target.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question is going to come from Stephen Chin from UBS. Please go ahead with your question.
Stephen Chin
Eric, if I could ask a little more color on the increased use of the distribution partners. I know that you guys have used some of them in the past, but just with the increase recently. I was wondering if you could talk a bit more about, number one, is that all still being, with the sales there, is that still being recognized on the sell through basis for all of them? And also are there certain product areas or product lines that you're focusing on in using where you can sell through that distribution channel? And whether or not that helps increase your visibility on orders or not?
Scott McGregor
Yes, Stephen. So you're right. You'll see that in the K that excluding fulfillment distributors have actually over the last three years gone up about 4 points in our mix relative to distribution. Much of that is our strategy to sort of go after some of the longer tail opportunities in the business. Certainly things like IoT lend themselves to things that run through distribution, where our size and nature of our support network don't do it. So we've talked about sort of expanding our distribution footprint and you can actually now begin to see it in the numbers.
In terms of the way we recognize revenue, we do still and have for as long as I've been here, recognize revenue on a sell-through basis. So what we ship to the distributors is not recorded as revenue until they actually sell out. In terms of visibility, I think it's a segmentation question for the business and using distribution to sort of segment the part of the market that we wouldn't naturally have good visibility to and then to leverage those partners to use us where they need to, to broaden the footprint and so between distribution and some of the things Scott mentioned in terms of the website relative to WICED, I think we're getting good traction on moving those things forward.
Operator
Thank you. We have no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the call back over to Scott McGregor.
Scott McGregor
Thanks everyone for joining today. 2014 was a pivotal year for Broadcom, in which the company made a number of important profit enhancing business decisions and we refocused on our areas of strength. We believe we're a stronger company now as a result of this. I would like to thank our employees and all of our investors for their support as we made this transition. With that, thank you very much and have a good day.
