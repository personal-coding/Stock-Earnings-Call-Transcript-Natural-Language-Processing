Good morning, and welcome to Noble Energy's Third Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. Following today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note this event is being recorded.
I would now like to turn the conference over to Brad Whitmarsh. Please go ahead.
Brad Whitmarsh - Director-Investor Relations
Thanks, Jamie. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. This morning, we issued our quarterly earnings release and we also posted to our website a number of supplemental slides for this call. You will find them helpful as we talk through our prepared comments. Later this morning, our 10-Q will be available on the website as well.
Following prepared comments, we'll open the call for question-and-answer and we'll complete in approximately an hour. We would ask the participants limit themselves to one primary question and one follow-up. Management members participating today are Dave Stover, Chairman, and CEO; Ken Fisher, Executive VP and CFO; Gary Willingham, Executive VP of Operations; and Susan Cunningham, Executive VP of Exploration and New Ventures.
I want to remind everyone that this webcast and conference call contains projections and forward-looking statements, as well as certain non-GAAP financial measures. You should read our full disclosures in the latest news release and SEC filings for a discussion of those items.
With that, I'll turn it over to Dave.
David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Thanks, Brad. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We had a great quarter. And as you can see from our operating results, we were able to achieve more, while spending less. Before discussing specific items, I want to take a moment to reflect on the quarter. First, I'm extremely pleased with the fact that we were able to significantly reduce capital and controllable costs, while still delivering outstanding organic volume growth.
Second, it is notable that discretionary cash flow was greater than our capital this quarter. And third, we saw continued capital efficiencies in our onshore program, supporting returns and margin improvements in the business. This all positions us to extremely well for finishing the year strong, and beginning 2016 even stronger.
Starting the rest of our discussion with capital expenditures, we continue a trend of reducing our quarterly capital. This has come not only from adjusting our activity levels, but also from our relentless focus on increasing operating efficiencies and driving down well costs. Capital expenditures for the third quarter were down approximately 20% from the second quarter of this year, and 50% from the first quarter. This was accomplished, despite the incremental capital allocated to our new Texas assets, beginning this quarter. We've made great progress towards our goal of aligning capital with cash flows.
Full year 2015, capital has now been reduced to slightly less than $3 billion, approximately $100 million under previous expectation. While working the capital side of the business, we put an equal effort into bringing controllable unit costs down. We've reduced third-quarter lease operating expense and total production cost per barrel of oil equivalent to their lowest level in five years. These results have been delivered, while maintaining a best-in-class safety record and the lowest recordable incident rate in our history. So, I couldn't be more pleased with the efforts of our business units.
Operationally, we've continued our tremendous momentum. Sales volumes for the third quarter totaled 379,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, substantially outperforming both original guidance and our raised expectations.
I am pleased that each asset in the portfolio delivered higher volumes than our original forecast for the third quarter. And we're carrying that overall momentum into the fourth quarter. We have raised fourth quarter volumes now to range between 385,000 and 405,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. A major contributor to our performance has been the DJ Basin. The operating teams have done an amazing job, enhancing value by realizing material efficiency gains, drilling longer laterals and improving completion techniques.
Third quarter sales volumes averaged a record 116,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day and total liquids production was a quarterly record as well, up 10,000 barrels per day from a year ago, most of which is crude volumes. This quarter, we saw the positive impact of the late June startup of DCP's Lucerne-2 plant. Lower line pressures helped our legacy vertical production, which averaged 25,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day during the quarter. This is an increase of more than 5,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day above pre Lucerne-2 rates.
Additional infrastructure build-out continues with the Grand Parkway low pressure line-loop system. This project is on schedule for startup at the end of this year or early next year and will further improve gas infrastructure reliability in the Basin. Drilling performance continues to be exceptional, and we have lowered spud-to-rig release times from standard lateral wells to between five days and six days. Total well costs including allocated facilities capital are on track to be below $3.5 million in Wells Ranch for a standard lateral.
We're also on track to be less than $3 million for a normalized long lateral. We've continued to modify completion techniques and we are seeing good success with slickwater fluid completions in certain areas.
On slide eight, we have highlighted a recent development area, which includes our first slickwater wells in Wells Ranch. Early results show strong production performance and lower overall well costs. During the quarter, we closed on the merger with Rosetta Resources, which established new core operating positions for Noble Energy in the Eagle Ford and Delaware Basins.
While still early, initial results show that we are materially enhancing the value of these assets. Since closing, we drilled seven Lower Eagle Ford wells, and one Delaware Wolfcamp A well. And have already substantially reduced spud-to-rig release times in both plays. In the Eagle Ford, spud-to-rig release times averaged eight days for a 5,000-foot lateral, a reduction of approximately 30% from the average on these assets earlier this year.
And our first operated well on the Delaware Basin was drilled 10 days faster than the average of prior wells on our acreage. Production performance in the Lower Eagle Ford remains very strong. We've highlighted on slide nine the two most recent well results, which are Noble Energy's initial designed and executed completions in the Eagle Ford. They include modified completion designs versus the historical practice on these assets.
Most wells are performing materially above the 3 million-barrel type curve for the area. In fact, the most recent well, which is still in flow back, looks to be the best well ever completed on the acreage. These are strong and improving early results, highlighting the very productive nature of this acreage position and the value from Noble's technical expertise.
Moving forward, we have plans to continue testing enhanced completion designs. Including, reduced stage and cluster spacing that we've brought from our other onshore plays. We anticipate a one-rig program in the Eagle Ford and a one-rig program in the Delaware, as we exit this year.
Now, turning to our offshore operations. Both Big Bend and Dantzler, recently commenced production. I want to commend our exploration, appraisal and development teams for their outstanding performance on this project. Delivering both fields ahead of schedule and on budget, extends our exceptional track record of major project execution and highlights the competitive advantage for Noble.
Production is quickly ramping to an expected combined grows maximum rate of over 40,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day or about 20,000 per day net to Noble. In fact, Big Bend has already tested close to full rate over the weekend. And Dantzler, should ramp up quickly as well. These fields are major contributors to our fourth quarter and 2016 cash flow and oil volume growth.
At Gunflint, the rig has completed drilling operations, and wells completions are underway. Installation of pipelines and subsea equipment has begun. And first production remains on schedule for mid-2016.
Moving to West Africa. Our operated projects at both Aseng and Alen continued to outperform internal estimates. The non-operated Alba compression project, which will stem field decline and extend productive resource life, advanced to over 80% complete, and is on schedule for startup mid next year.
As expected, temporary Alba field shut-in while installing the compression module, will result in a sizable impact to both first quarter and second quarter 2016 sales volumes. On the exploration front, our initial operated well offshore the Falkland Islands provide substantial knowledge about the petroleum system. We will use well results to recalibrate the seismic interpretation.
The Humpback play was just one of several play types across our vast 10 million acres. At the end of the year or beginning of next year, we will drill the Rhea Prospect in the Northern license area, which is adjacent to proven oil discoveries. Results should be available toward the end of the first quarter.
In Israel, our natural gas sales averaged a record 305 million cubic feet of gas per day during the third quarter, an increase of 15% from the same period last year. For the month of August and most of September, the field averaged over 1 billion cubic feet per day and stellar operational performance continued with nearly 100% uptime at the facilities.
Marketing efforts in the Eastern Mediterranean continue, where regional demand for our natural gas remains strong. The recent Egyptian discovery by another operator, which is targeted to domestic Egyptian use for power and industrials has heightened the interest in the Basin.
Regional customers remain under-supplied by almost 4 billion cubic feet of natural gas per day now, and we estimate that shortfall growing to 9 billion cubic feet per day by 2025. The proven reliability and performance at Tamar, along with the fully appraised and flow tested Leviathan field, have us well-positioned to supply gas to this under-supplied region.
During the third quarter, a number of significant steps were completed to provide a clear line of sight for the next round of project developments in the region. The regulatory framework for hydrocarbon development was finalized and approved by the Israeli Cabinet and the Knesset. And Israeli government is currently taking action to follow through on this framework. Yesterday's announcement from the Prime Minister's office is a further indication of the commitment to moving forward with gas development.
So, as we're approaching 2016, we intend to be cash flow neutral or better, while maintaining long-term operational capacity. Our diversified portfolio provides exceptional investment optionality and we will continue to be extremely disciplined and diligent in our capital allocation process.
Next year's onshore capital program will again focus on those activities with the highest returns and values. Our positions in the DJ Basin and Texas should continue to attract the majority of our investment. Offshore capital will mainly be attributed to our one-rig exploration and appraisal program in the Gulf of Mexico, until Israel projects are sanctioned.
While exploration capital will remain lower in 2016 than previous years, we believe this is a great environment to enhance and deepen our exploration inventory of high quality opportunities at a relatively low cost of entry. Although production growth is not the focus, our 2016 volumes will likely be higher than pro forma 2015 levels.
The momentum of our business can deliver this at significantly lower capital program than this year. As I mentioned at the beginning of my comments, we intend to continue achieving more, while spending less. I believe, we are well-positioned to build a great future.
With that, Jamie, I'd like to open the call for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
We'll now begin the question-and-answer session. We'll take our first call from Evan Calio with Morgan Stanley.
Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Hi, good morning, guys and great operational results today.
David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Thank you, Morgan â Evan.
Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Yeah. It's Evan, yes. I know it's early for the budget and I appreciate your comments earlier. Yet philosophically, how are you thinking about that budget in terms of what you're solving for, right? Your offshore startups, your DUCs, your operational momentums, you clearly have an ability to grow volumes within cash flow at the strip. Are you looking to generate free cash flow into 2016? Or are you solving for more minimal operational capabilities through the trough? Any color there would be appreciated.
David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
No. I appreciate them. I think, we're still in the early stage of the finalizing the plans for next year. You've hit on a couple of the key elements. We are going to manage within cash flow, that's the way we're setting ourselves up.
I think at the same time, as you mentioned we have a lot of flexibility, especially when you look at the overall portfolio. So I think, as we look to next year, we're going to make sure we maintain our financial strength, we're going to make sure we allocate the capital to the projects with a greatest returns and value. And then at the same time, we'll maintain the financial strength. We're going to watch and make sure we're keeping the operational capacity, such that as things do turnaround and we get into a higher price environment, we're well-positioned to be able to take advantage of that very quickly. I think those are all some of the things that we think about as we're looking at next year.
Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Great. And then maybe I could switch gears on Israel. I appreciate your, the macro demand commentary and the update. Once the framework is approved there, which could be any day, could you provide color on what happens next? I mean, where are you in the process of Leviathan feed or Tamar expansion? Any range of potential capital spend there in 2016?
David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Right. I think to start with, we'd still expect minimal capital spend in 2016. The main pieces that will come together as you move forward with the framework, you have the contracts, you have the actual contracts, the marketing arrangements if you will, moving those LOIs to executed contracts, that will move forward. The same time, that will setup the opportunity to finalize financing and in conjunction with all of that we'll be going to back up to the market to bring in the new costs for the projects in the new market environment.
So I think what we've continued to say is now that the framework has been approved and moving forward with that. We've been looking at kind of a timeframe of about a year to bring all of this together to move to FID.
Evan Calio - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
Great. Appreciate it guys.

We'll take our next question from Charles Meade with Johnson Rice.
Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC
Good morning, Dave and to the rest of your team there.
David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Hi, Charles.
Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC
Dave, you made â I want to follow-up your comments you made about Equatorial Guinea in 2016. I know you said that you're â I believe you said, you're adding compression at Alba facility and that's going to negatively impact volumes in the first half. Is that mostly going to be â mostly gas? Or can you give a little more detail on what that impact will be?
David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
That's really on the full field. I think the expectation, Charles, is that towards the end of the â midway towards the end of the first quarter, you'll see the full field go down for about â oh, half a month. And then, I think about another month of partial or half field impact. So it will be a mix of the full field impact. But that's as we expected that's no different than what we have been planning for since we started the compression projects. So that's all been accounted for in the way we continued to look at 2016 and...
Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC
Got it. That makes sense and is helpful. And then shifting back over to the DJ, where you guys have had great results, particularly this last quarter. But it's a little â could you give us the narrative in your mind about how you progressed to the slickwater fracs? And really I guess the question is, is this something that just works in the oil â is more appropriate for the more oil rich areas and that you guys were really on this hybrid gel frac? Really because that was what was typical for the field more in the gas center of it? How has this progression worked?
David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Well, I'd say starting with, I'm extremely pleased that the team continues to look at what's the next step, next evolution and development here, they're always kind of pushing the envelope and testing what could be even more efficient. I think I'll let Gary kind of expand and talk about how they've thought through this process and how it applies?
Gary W. Willingham - Executive Vice President-Operations
Yeah, Charles, we've talked about many times in the past, how we're constantly looking for ways to improve our completions out there and also how we don't expect one optimal completion design to work across the entire field, it's likely to be different, depending on where we are operating at any given time. So where we've been focusing the slickwater completions most recently is in East Pony and Wells Ranch, which is the oilier part of the field.
We haven't really had that much activity back in the core gassy part of Wattenberg recently. So, too early to say, whether slickwaters might provide some benefit there in the future. Again, we're focused on Wells Ranch and East Pony right now. But seeing some very nice results, there's a slide in the pack that shows an area of Wells Ranch, where we've got a number of slickwater wells that are significantly outperforming the gelled hybrid jobs in those areas.
We're seeing similar results in East Pony and we'll continue to test that as we go forward. And it also reduces our well cost by about $400,000 per well. So it's a good performance to-date.
Charles A. Meade - Johnson Rice & Co. LLC
Yeah. All right, Gary, thanks for that detail.

We'll take our next question from Doug Leggate with Bank of America.
Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Thanks, good morning, everybody. So a quick follow-up on that last question, if I may. So the slickwater, I think you said in your commentary, that there were some areas where you're choosing to move forward with that. What's the differentiating factor as to why that wouldn't be deployed across the whole play? I guess as an add-on, what are the implications for how we should think about the type curve that you've given us in those areas?
David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, I think it's just too early to say what other parts of the Basin it will be applicable to, Doug. As you know, we like to move in a fairly measured approach as we test new completion techniques and like to show that it's repeatable before we just make wholesale changes across the Basin. So, we'll continue to monitor these wells, we'll shift more activity in these specific areas to slickwater in the near future. But before we're ready to declare that's the right way to go across the Basin, we'll just take a more measured approach to it.
I think as far as the uplift, I think if you look at the performance on those wells, on the slide for Wells Ranch, I'd say that that's the performance that we're seeing to-date, no reason to suspect our near-term activity in Wells Ranch, where we're using slickwater that we'd see anything different than that.
Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Okay. But no formal upgrade at this point, but pretty much is, the writing's pretty much on the wall; right?
David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, I mean, I think you can look at the early performance and probably draw some conclusions, we don't have enough data yet to really come out with the new EUR type curve over the life of the well, given how recent it's been, but you can probably draw some conclusions based on that early data.
Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
[Okay].
David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
But as we've done in the past, we usually like to get three months, six months or longer production and then reevaluate.
Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Got it. My follow-up is really I guess is going back to the capital question for next year, really more of capital allocation between the Lower 48, Permian relative to DJ. I'm just wondering if you've got any early look as to how you're thinking about how you might allocate? I'm thinking really more about the potential to ramp in the Permian in favor over the DJ? Or just how you're thinking about it at this point? I'll leave it there. Thank you.
David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
That's probably a little early to get into too much of that. But we've laid out at last call our initial look, coming out of the box with Rosetta of how we would start to ramp up the Delaware Basin over next couple of years. The bigger ramp in Delaware, I think, really starts in 2017, but we'll be evaluating both the returns and value-add per incremental capital in each of those areas between â specially between DJ, Eagle Ford and Permian and it gives us a lot of flexibility now, with all three of those assets that are performing very well.
Doug Leggate - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Okay. Appreciate the answer, Dave. Thanks very much.

We'll next go to Ryan Todd with Deutsche Bank.
Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Great, thanks. Good morning, gentlemen. Maybe if I could follow-up one on CapEx. Can you talk a little about the drivers of the lower CapEx level on this quarter? And then as you look at fourth-quarter CapEx, is that kind of low $600 million run rate, is that a reasonable run rate and kind of activities level into 2016? Or should we expect negative or positive drivers one way or the other into next year?
David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Well, I think when you look at third quarter for this year, that's kind of an outcome of the way we set up the program starting the year, where we rapidly got in motion to bring down activity. And for example in the DJ, we've ramped down pretty quickly on activity. We brought the Marcellus and that alignment with our partner in the Marcellus to bring down activity there, start to see some of the roll-off and getting through the completion of some of the deepwater Gulf of Mexico projects. So, not a huge surprise to us. I think the other element there though, we started to see actual cost per well come down pretty dramatically too. So that factored in to, I guess being a little ahead of where we expected to be by that time in the third quarter, and you're seeing all of that carryover into the fourth quarter.
I think as far as read through the next year. I mean still too early to give out any specifics, but I think as we mentioned earlier, we're going to be managing within cash flow for next year. We've got a lot of flexibility on activity levels that probably the big swing pieces will be our onshore activity. And again, we'll focus that between what we just talked about in the Texas assets and the DJ Basin is the â what's the right activity level there.
Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Great. Thanks. And then maybe if you could talk broadly about your exploration strategy going forward. How much of the budget should we expect to see allocated to exploration going forward? Should it be a similar level to 2015? Or I guess any of your comments in terms of how that fits within a broader context of capital allocation over the next couple years.
David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. Let me give you a few comments on how I see it and Susan, maybe expand on how she's thinking about exploration in this environment. But it will be a low level, again next year, it was around 5% or so of our capital this year. I don't see it being much beyond that next year. The focus next year will probably be in the Gulf of Mexico as far as actual drilling activity.
But then the rest of it is looking at how we build inventory right now, and let me ask Susan, that just expand a little bit on her comments about this environment?
Susan M. Cunningham - Executive VP-Global Exploration & New Ventures
Yeah, we're really focused. This is a great time to really be focused on getting the best quality portfolio that we can possibly get. We do expect that our percentage in terms of capital in 2016 might be a little higher than this year just because the capital is down and we're drilling in the Gulf of Mexico a little bit, but not significantly. So, it's really going to be focused on building the portfolio with real quality possibilities.
Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Good. Would that entail â I guess as you look forward, there's a lot of people exiting offshore plays and deepwater assets around the world. Would you guys look to take advantage in terms of increasing your exposure to longer term resource and acreage going forward?
David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
I think so. I think the advantage we have is, we have an exploration staff that's had a tremendous amount of success in the past, that gives us that capability right now where others may not have that, and I think that creates opportunity. I mean when you step back and look at it, we're benefiting from that capability with our three offshore assets now that are delivering tremendous margin and stability. So I think it's something we'll continue to look at. But I think you can do that in this environment at a relatively low cost versus what we've seen in the past few years.
Ryan Todd - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Great. Thank you.

We'll next go to Steven Richardson with Evercore ISI.
Stephen Richardson - Evercore ISI
Good morning.
David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Hi, Steve.
Stephen Richardson - Evercore ISI
Hi. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about Israel. I appreciate your prepared remarks, Dave. But one question was, in terms of talking about an FID maybe 12 months from now on a project, can you delve a little bit deeper into what that means for â is it one FID for both Leviathan and this prospective export project from Tamar? How are you thinking about the linkages or the de-linkages of those two projects? And if you could, any idea on kind of timing between FID and kind of first sales from the project scope you're looking at?
David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Sure, Steve. I think the â nice part or one of the nice elements of this framework, it actually delinked Tamar and Leviathan. So we're actually looking at those as two separate FIDs. And the timing on Tamar is really going to be dependent on getting that contract with the Union Fenosa LNG facility, hammered out and being able to move forward, from that standpoint, Leviathan will be tied to getting its contracts lined out and then the project financing actually pulled together for both of those. I think when you look at actual first production, we've been talking three years to four years from FID, the first production.
There is probably an opportunity that Tamar's project could be probably a little bit quicker than Leviathan, but we'll just have to see how that plays out. The other thing we're keeping a close eye on to and I didn't really mention it on the prepared comments, but just this interruptible volume to Egypt is actually could be the first project to come online at very little cost to us, but significance from the standpoint of establishing an export arrangement between Israel and in neighboring countries. So that's the other one we're keeping an eye on as we're moving over the next few months too.
Stephen Richardson - Evercore ISI
Great. Thanks. Just a quick follow-up on the Marcellus. I guess one question, clearly that seems like an area, just listening to your partner's remarks as well, that this is a place where we could see Noble just draw down the inventory of DUCs next year and limit capital based on your view of higher returns elsewhere. I guess what would have to happen for you to change that view? Is it a question of, is there a certain â would $1 higher gas price kind of make that project compete for returns elsewhere? If you could just kind of size â what's the hurdle rate to get capital back into the Marcellus, I guess is what I'm getting at.
David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Well, I think we're well aligned with our partner to manage within cash flow. So, obviously every Delaware gas price improvement helps the cash flow out in that area and we'll continue to look at it. I think you're right from the standpoint that the plan going into next year at least as we're both looking at it now, is to focus on completion activity and being pretty selective and judicial on how we manage that. And then we'll just have to keep watching the market. As we've talked about this doesn't feel like the gas price to drill into in that market, but we'll just continue to watch how that changes.
We've got tremendous amount of flexibility because the acreage is pretty much all held by production, which was another key advantage of the partnership when we got into that arrangement. So that just gives us a lot of flexibility to manage it and we're well aligned with our partners. So that's a good position to be in going into the year.
Stephen Richardson - Evercore ISI
Great. Thank you.

We'll take our next question from Bob Brackett with Sanford Bernstein.
Bob Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC
I had a question on the Texas assets. It looks like they were producing maybe 66,000 in 1Q. And they're running at 54,000 for 3Q. What's causing that decline? Is that a drop in CapEx or a build in DUCs or something else?
David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
I'll have, Gary, expand. Bob, I'll tell you, it's right on track with what we've projected when we modeled this for the acquisition. We fully expected that third quarter would be a low quarter, probably the low quarter for the year based on the way we saw activity shaping up. But, Gary, can give you some other color.
Gary W. Willingham - Executive Vice President-Operations
Yeah. No, Bob it's tied to completion timing. You might remember that Rosetta's full-year guidance for the assets was 60,000 for the year, they had it coming down through the year as Dave said, 3Q was always indented to be the low point of the year. So I'd say we're right on track with what we've anticipated all along.
David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
But I think what...
Bob Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC
And then...
David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
But the only thing I was going to add, Bob, what we've seen from the results of what we've focused on so far. I think we're in position and kind of our overall theme just to be able to do more with spending less out there as we're seeing on both the initial wells out of the box on drilling and then some of these initial completions.
Gary W. Willingham - Executive Vice President-Operations
Yeah. Efficiencies are definitely trending up better than we had modeled actually, you'll recall that we, few months ago, increased our type curve for the area. Our most recent wells in the Eagle Ford are exceeding even that increased type curve by 3% to 5% at least, so we put a slide out there and has some commentary on a couple other most recent wells, we think the one that's in early stages of flowback right now is probably the best well ever completed on the acreage, that's the result of bringing a lot of their completion design concept that we've refined in the DJ and the Marcellus to the Eagle Ford. So, it's going to be interesting to see what we're able to do here in the next few months, I think.
Bob Alan Brackett - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC
And you think a rig in each Basin will be enough to hold production flat?
David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Well, I think that's where we're going to start off and I think with this drilling efficiencies that we're seeing is fair to model more wells per rig certainly for 2016 than what's been done in the past.
Gary W. Willingham - Executive Vice President-Operations
Actually, when you look at what we've laid out there and consistent with starting off with the rig in each of those Basins, we actually expect this volume will continue to grow. We don't see that 15% growth, average growth over the next three years changing from what we've laid out, managing within cash flows, so nothing has changed on that. In fact, we're feeling even better about it.
David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Right.

And we'll next go to Leo Mari, I'm sorry, John Herrlin with Societe Generale.
John P. Herrlin - SG Americas Securities LLC
Yes, thank you. You mentioned savings that you are getting with things like slickwater. And you talked about improvements in the Eagle Ford, et cetera. What kind of well designs are you using that are different? Are you're dropping intermediate stream casing? Are you doing sliding sleeve? Plug-and-perf? What's kind of different in your approach, if anything?
David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
In the DJ?
John P. Herrlin - SG Americas Securities LLC
Yes. And in the Eagle Ford.
David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, in the DJ, slickwater has been the biggest driver so far of bringing those costs down. We are doing some mono-bore completions like you've heard from others, which allows you to drop that intermediate string of casing. So we're testing that to ensure that we think that's a viable economic solution going forward, but we are doing some of that. In the Eagle Ford, most of the improvement has come on bringing, again, those same completion techniques from the Marcellus and the DJ.
So reduced stage and cluster spacing in this most recent well that we expect to be the best ever is a reduced stage and cluster spacing well, it's roughly 2,000 pounds of sand per foot, and like I said performing very well. So we are continuing to test a number of things, but we seemed to be on the right track.
John P. Herrlin - SG Americas Securities LLC
Great. Thanks. Next one for me, on Israel, I know it's early. You're not at FID and all that. But E&C costs have to be coming down. Do you have any kind of sense where things are now versus when you were looking a few years back?
David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
No, not yet. What we didn't want to do is get out ahead of ourselves on rebidding cost. So we'll get into that as we move through 2016 and that's when I'll start to have a real sense is to how much. I mean you've got to believe when you look at the number of projects that have been delayed or deferred that the use of this equipment, which is a lot of the high cost piece, lay vessels and so forth, is going to be coming down just based on usage.
We know rig costs are down, way down from what we had, I'm sure, assumed originally, when we put the estimates together seeing â you can see where the moving pieces ought to apply some downward pressure. But in totality, we won't have some real insight into that probably until mid-year or so.
John P. Herrlin - SG Americas Securities LLC
Thanks, Dave.

We'll next go to Leo Mariani with RBC.
Leo Mariani - RBC Capital Markets LLC
Hey, guys. Just had a question around the drilled uncompleted inventory. I think in your press release, you guys talked about 50 wells in Texas, 40 wells in the DJ and 80 wells in the Marcellus. I'm assuming that the Marcellus obviously is built up as a result of dropping the rigs here. But just curious if the Texas DUCs and the DJ are more a normal course of business? Are you guys purposely trying to defer some of the completions here because of low price environment? Are there commodity price hurdles that you're hoping to hit before you start fracking these wells in each of the areas?
Gary W. Willingham - Executive Vice President-Operations
Leo, this is Gary. I'd say it's more normal course of business. We're not intentionally building up drilled/uncompleted inventory in any area.
Leo Mariani - RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. And are there any commodity price hurdles you guys are hoping to see in the Marcellus before you start bringing those wells online?
Gary W. Willingham - Executive Vice President-Operations
Well, I think as Dave has mentioned, we're trending towards cash flow neutral for a budget for the Marcellus next year, that's kind of where we're seeing it with our partners. So we're taking that into account. As you know, we've laid down all the drilling rigs. We've had some completion activity towards the end of this year and then we'll have more completion activity next year versus drilling activity. We'll just have to monitor that as we go relative to the price and the impact on cash flow, Leo.
Leo Mariani - RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. And I guess your costs were extremely low this quarter. You guys cited at a five-year record here. Just looking at your guidance, it looks like you are expecting costs to uptick a little bit in the fourth quarter. Is something sort of going on there? Is it more just a function of being conservative? Can you explain that a little bit?
David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Well, you've got some mix, you'll have a much larger impact of the Gulf of Mexico, the new production coming in from the Gulf, which is at a little higher operating cost. You've got the Eastern Med dropping off significantly, seasonally as it always does in the fourth quarter, expect it to. And those are probably the two main pieces â just as two mixes.
Leo Mariani - RBC Capital Markets LLC
Okay. Thanks, guys.

And we'll take our next question from Irene Haas with Wunderlich.
Irene Oiyin Haas - Wunderlich Securities, Inc.
Yes. This is really focused on the Appalachia. And it looks like you guys are pulling back on the Marcellus a little, waiting for things to improve. And my question for you is, how do you feel about the Utica? I noticed that you have a well in Marshall County, West Virginia. I was just wondering how much it cost at this stage? And then when do we really kind of need to treat the Utica dry gas as the next Marcellus?
David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Well, that's a good question, Irene, on the last one. We just don't have that much history and that much Utica acreage to have a strong opinion on it relative to the Marcellus. I'd tell you, we'll start to get some insight from our own operations here as we bring our first Utica well on probably later this year. But then I think the real question on the Utica has been kind of the decline relative to the Marcellus, and as you referenced, the overall cost of projects at the deeper depth.
So, we don't have a big inventory. We've probably got probably 20,000 acres or so of Utica position that we've brought in along with our partners. We've picked up additional acreage out in the Basin, but we're probably in the early stages of us doing that. Gary, may have some other insight from his perspective.
Gary W. Willingham - Executive Vice President-Operations
Yeah, when Dave says 20,000 acres, that's the gross, that's in the JV, that we have an interest in, so our net is about half that, about 10,000 acres. We just drilled the one well, so I think it's too early to speculate on what cost would be on a development type scenario, because we've done quite a bit of science on this first well. But we do expect to have it on here in the fourth quarter, and should be able to start talking about it a bit more on the call next year.
Irene Oiyin Haas - Wunderlich Securities, Inc.
How much did you spend at this first well?
Gary W. Willingham - Executive Vice President-Operations
It's in the $15+ million range on this first well, but like I said, there is quite a bit of science in that one.
Irene Oiyin Haas - Wunderlich Securities, Inc.
Yeah...
Gary W. Willingham - Executive Vice President-Operations
We'd look to that as a development well scenario.
Irene Oiyin Haas - Wunderlich Securities, Inc.
Got you. Thank you.

And we'll take our next question from Michael Rowe with TPH [Tudor, Pickering, Holt].
Michael J. Rowe - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.
Yes, good morning. I just had one question about the DJ Basin. So you mentioned, you're dropping a rig late â in the latter part of this year, but you're drilling wells more quickly. And your anticipated well count's a bit higher for the year than budgeted. So, can you just provide a little bit more context around kind of how the well count's going to change for the full year? And any changes to the capital budget for that region as well.
Gary W. Willingham - Executive Vice President-Operations
Yeah Michael. This is Gary. I think it's â again it's driven by efficiency. So we've recently dropped to three rigs from four rigs. I don't see our latest guidance on well count changing that much, given the increasing efficiency, we continue to see. I think the last numbers we put out there was about 200 wells plus or minus, actual well count and about 250 wells on an equivalent basis.
David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
I think our change to DJ capital occurred first half of the year when we actually shifted some money into the DJ earlier in the year, and that turned out to be a pretty smart move with what we've seen from the impact of the Lucerne-2 plant coming on.
Michael J. Rowe - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.
Okay. Great. And then lastly, just on the Gulf of Mexico wells, these are obviously coming online and adding quite a bit of production cash flow over the next 12 months. Can you just remind us kind of how we should think about the production profile and declines for these wells over the first, call it, 12 months to 24 months?
David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, I'd say over the first 12 months, once we get them fully lined out here towards the end of November. So, I think they'll hold pretty flat. I mean there will be some ups and downs, but they'll hold pretty flat through the first 12 months. And then, I'd say decline from after the first year or so, it's probably 20% to 30% range. Now, the nice part about it is that it's not the end of the opportunities in that Rio Grande area, because one of the things we'll be looking at pretty hard over the first year, is the potential based on production performance for another development well at Big Bend and also potential for water injection support going forward. So, lot of things still to look at out there and we'll see how that fully plays out.
Michael J. Rowe - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.
Okay. Thanks.

Our next question comes from Mike Kelly with Seaport Global.
Mike Kelly - Seaport Global Securities LLC
Hi, guys. Good morning.
David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Hi, Mike.
Mike Kelly - Seaport Global Securities LLC
I was hoping to get a better understanding for Israel in 2016. And I'm interested, if we assume similar weather next year versus 2015, what organic growth could be? One, just no change to â on the regulatory front. Two, if we do have a comprehensive agreement signed here in the next couple of weeks? Thanks.
David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
If you're talking about volumes, I think we're going into next year. I think it will be relatively flat. We benefited this year from the fact that we had the compression project that Ashdod fully up and running. And so we were able to take full advantage of that this past quarter. And you can see the nice impact from that. I think the wildcard over there is, if we can get this interruptible supply agreement and actually start physically moving volumes from Israel to Egypt next year. We're not assuming anything for that at this point until it happens. But that could be a significant opportunity.
Mike Kelly - Seaport Global Securities LLC
How quick could that be up and running, Dave?
David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
I think physically up and running, I think you can do it in a matter of months. I think it's all a matter of getting the agreements, finalized, getting both governments signed up and onboard. And I know they're both very supportive from all discussions. And then getting all the agreements with the owners of the pipeline in place and gas moving. But as far as physical activity to move gas, it doesn't take much, I don't think.
Mike Kelly - Seaport Global Securities LLC
Okay. Great. And my follow-up is kind of longer term, if we look at Leviathan and Tamar. And I know there's a lot of moving parts and variables here and it might be way premature to ask this, but if you guys are thinking about this in terms of, on the potential internal NAV of these projects, how should we think about it? How really impactful could these projects be to you? Thanks.
David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
I think if you just take a look and you model out the cash flows per year from the types of volumes, when you look at â for Leviathan, adding over a Bcf a day, we've talked about on average maybe 1.2 Bcf a day or so forth, when it's fully up and running here on the initial phase. When you look at Tamar adding 400 million cubic feet a day to 500 million cubic feet a day and you just model those cash flows out, it starts to give you an impression of how impactful those projects can be.
Mike Kelly - Seaport Global Securities LLC
All right. Appreciate it. Thanks, guys.

Your next question comes from David Beard with Coker & Palmer.
David Earl Beard - Coker & Palmer, Inc.
Hi, good morning, everyone.
David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Good morning, Dave.
David Earl Beard - Coker & Palmer, Inc.
Two questions for you, a macro and a micro. On the macro front, how closely linked in your mind are changes in commodity prices for changes in CapEx? So that's first. And then second on the micro front, just back up to the DJ and the slickwater fracs, can we think of applying these to the majority of the Wells Ranch wells and even at the longer lateral lengths? And maybe just talk about what's going on at East Pony on slickwater versus Wells Ranch.
David L. Stover - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer
Let me take the first one, and I'll let Gary take the second part of that. But on the CapEx versus commodity price, I mean they are linked from the standpoint of our focus, especially in these lower commodity price world of managing within cash flow. So it's going to be a direct linkage there between what commodity price is and how it impacts our cash flow and therefore what capital we invest. So...
Gary W. Willingham - Executive Vice President-Operations
Yeah. And on the slickwater, how we roll that out, like I said, we're focusing on Wells Ranch and East Pony right now, it seems to be working quite well in those areas, we'll continue to test it in those areas, that's where most of our activity is going to be next year anyway. As far as the long laterals, we're certainly pumping slickwater on long laterals, I would say on the longest laterals, the 9,000 foot type wells, we're still pumping the gelled hybrid in those first few stages in the toe, just because if we have a screen out situation, it's a bit more problematic and costly to get those cleaned out, so we want to make sure we can carry the sand the whole way, but otherwise we're pumping slickwater on the majority of those as well.
David Earl Beard - Coker & Palmer, Inc.
Great. Appreciate the color. Thank you.
