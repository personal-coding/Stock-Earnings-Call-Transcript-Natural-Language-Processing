Greg Gantt
Good morning, and welcome to our first quarter conference call. With me on the call today is Adam Satterfield, our CFO. After some brief remarks, we will be glad to take your questions. The early team successfully launched another year by delivering first quarter results that included new company records for both revenue and earnings per diluted share.
We began the year with significant momentum in our business and expected that we would continue to win market share in 2022. This expectation has already become reality, as the 32.9% increase in revenue was the fifth straight quarter where we recorded double-digit revenue growth. We also improved our operating ratios to a first quarter company record of 72.9%, which drove our seventh straight quarter of double-digit growth in earnings per diluted share.
Our revenue growth for the quarter included a 17.4% increase in LTL revenue per hundredweight and a 12% increase in LTL tons per day. The improvements in both freight density and yield created operating leverage that allowed us to improve our cost categories as a percent of revenue, which also drove the improvement in our operating ratio. Density and yield are the key ingredients to long-term improvement in our operating ratio, and both generally require the support of a favorable domestic economy. We expect to further improve each of these two elements as we work through 2022. Demand for our superior service has remained consistently strong. And we do not see that changing in the foreseeable future based on recent conversations with both our customers and our sales team.
We continue to receive feedback regarding the general lack of capacity within the LTL industry. This feedback is not unexpected given that the LTL industry has seen a net decrease in the number of service centers over the past 10 years. At least for the public group, excluding OD. Customers also appear to be dealing with lower inventory balances than they would prefer, which can result in missed revenue opportunities for them. We have unfortunately heard similar stories from our suppliers, and I've seen little improvement with their inventories this year.
We believe these issues are driving many new customers and increased shipments from existing customers to OD. Despite all of the general industry and supply chain challenges, Old Dominion has continued to maintain our service center capacity to support our customersâ growth. This has been and remains an integral piece of our value proposition, and we are well positioned to benefit from the continued strength in demand for both our superior service performance and network capacity.
We have opened three new service centers this year and currently have approximately 15% to 20% excess capacity. These additions were part of our 2022 expansion plan that targets an additional five to seven new facilities this year. While our service center network is in good shape, we are continuing to work on the other two pieces of the overall capacity equation. We increased our average number of full time employees by 18.5% during the first quarter, and we expect to continue hiring additional employees during the second quarter to support our anticipated growth.
As the capacity of the OD team increases, we would like to reduce our reliance on purchase transportation. To accomplish this, however, we will need to increase the capacity of our fleet. While our 2022 capital expenditure plan includes approximately $485 million for equipment, we are experiencing delays with the delivery of new equipment. These delays were anticipated and limit our ability to effectively match the receipt of new equipment, with the expected seasonal increase in our volumes. As a result, and similar to 2021, we will operate existing equipment that would have otherwise been replaced and use purchase transportation as needed to support our growth.
As part of our effort to deliver best-in-class service for our customers, we remain committed to ensuring that each element of capacity is in place to support our ability to win long-term market share. As we continue to manage through the short-term challenges within the current freight market, we will also maintain our focus on long-term opportunities for our business by continuing to execute on our long-term strategic plan. This plan has helped us achieve a 10-year compound average growth rate in revenue and earnings per diluted share of approximately 11% and 24%, respectively.
As part of this plan, we have consistently invested significant resources to support the doubling of our market share over the past 10 years. This has included a significant investment in our OD family of employees to help ensure that each employee is motivated and rewarded for providing superior service to our customers. We believe that consistently providing customers with superior service at a fair price and regularly investing in our people equipment and network capacity to stay ahead of anticipated volume growth will support our long-term growth initiatives. As a result, we are confident in our ability to continue to produce further profitable growth and increase shareholder value. Thanks for joining us this morning.
And now Adam will discuss our first quarter financial results in greater detail.
Adam Satterfield
Thank you, Greg, and good morning, Old Dominionâs revenue for the first quarter of 2022 increased 32.9% to a company record of $1.5 billion while our operating ratio improved 320 basis points to 72.9%. The combination of these factors resulted in a 52.9% increase in earnings per diluted share to $2.60 for the quarter. Our revenue per day increased 30.8% as the first quarter of this year included one extra work day. This growth was balanced between increases in our volumes and yield both of which continued to be supported by a favorable domestic economy.
We continued to win a significant amount of market share, as demand for our superior service and available network capacity remained consistently strong during the quarter. As a result, the year-over-year growth in our revenue and volumes continue to trend above our longer term averages. LTL tons per day increased 12% and our LTL revenue per hundredweight increased 17.4%. While changes in our freight mix contributed to the increase in this yield metric, the 10% increase in our LTL revenue per hundredweight excluding fuel surcharges reflects the success of our long-term pricing strategy.
Our consistent strategy is designed to offset cost inflation, while also supporting further investments in capacity by focusing on the individual profitability of each customer account. On a sequential basis, revenue per day for the first quarter increased 1.2% as compared to the fourth quarter of 2021, with LTL tons per day decreasing 1.4% and LTL shipments per day decreasing 2.2%. Our revenue per day performance during the first quarter both with and without fuel surcharges exceeded our 10 year average sequential trends. Although, our volumes were below our 10 year trends. It is important to remember, however, that our 10 year average trends include the doubling of our market share. As a result, there may be quarterly periods where sequential performance may be below our 10 year trends, despite solid year-over-year performance. The first quarter is a good example, as we believe we won a significant amount of market share and produce solid profitable growth as a result.
The monthly sequential changes in LTL tons per day during the first quarter were as follows. January decreased 5.8% as compared with December, February increased 5.1% versus January and March increased 3.6% as compared to February. The 10 year average change for the respective months are an increase of 1.6% in January, an increase of 1.7% in February, and an increase of 5.6% in March. While there are still a few workdays that remained in April, our revenue growth continues to be very strong and reflects the favorable demand environment described earlier by Greg. Our month-to-date revenue per day has increased by approximately 28% when compared to April 2021. We will provide the actual revenue related details for April in our first quarter Form 10-Q.
Our first quarter operating ratio improved to 72.9% with improvements in both our direct operating costs and overhead cost as a percent of revenue. Within our direct operating cost improvement in our salaries, wages and benefit cost as a percent of revenue effectively offset the increase in expenses for both our operating supplies and purchase transportation. The increase in operating supplies and expenses as a percent of revenue was primarily due to the increase in the cost of diesel fuel and other petroleum based products. We improved overhead cost as a percent of revenue during the first quarter primarily by leveraging our revenue growth and controlling discretionary spending. As mentioned on our fourth quarter call, we expect our core inflation excluding fuel to be between 4.5% to 5% for the year with higher inflation in the first half of the year is expected to moderate in the back half. We believe our fuel surcharge program is effectively offsetting the increased cost of our fuel. And our yield management strategy is effectively offsetting cost increases in other areas. As we continue to experience cost increases related to our real estate network, as well as with our equipment parts and repairs, it will be critical to maintain our focus on productivity, while continuing to control discretionary spending to minimize the overall effect on our costs per shipment.
Old Dominionâs cash flow from operations total $388.7 million for the first quarter, and capital expenditures were $93.7 million. We currently anticipate our capital expenditures to be approximately $825 million this year, which includes $300 million to expand the capacity of our service center network. We utilized $438.4 million of cash for our share repurchase program and paid $34.2 million in dividends during the first quarter. The total amount for share repurchases includes a $400 million accelerated share repurchase agreement that was executed during the first quarter. Our effective tax rate was 26.0% for the first quarter of 2022 and 2021. We currently expect our annual effective tax rate to be 26.0% for the second quarter 2022. This concludes our prepared remarks this morning. Operator, we will be happy to open the floor for questions at this time.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions]
And the first question today comes from Jon Chappell with Evercore.
Jon Chappell
Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Adam, if I could start with you, in the last few quarters, you can kind of throw all of your historical seasonal or trends out the window, just very robust pricing environment, and you're doing much better than 10-year trends. As you start to anniversary some of these big pricing and tonnage moves over the last several quarters, do you envision and return to kind of the long-term trend margin seasonality, or some of these vast market share gains that you're making going to continue to make those trend in a more favorable momentum?
Adam Satterfield
Well, I think that, certainly some of the quarters, those trends are very consistent. We've talked before about the first quarter and the fourth quarters can be a little bit more movement versus the average, just given the variability at times with revenue trends and those periods and certain cost, the trend and various ways in those periods as well. But I think we've certainly performed very well, the last couple of years and produced a lot of operating ratio improvement.
I think, regardless of the seasonal sequential changes from quarter-to-quarter, we always talk about the over the long-term that we generally expect, we've seen and would expect to continue to see 100 to 150 basis points of operating ratio improvement and a lot of that gets back to our focus with our pricing philosophy, we tried to achieve revenue per shipment growth of 100 to 150 basis points above our cost per shipment inflation. And when you look over the last 10, 15 years, including fuel in both of those metrics, that's what we've been able to achieve.
So certainly some years when we got significant revenue growth, like we saw last year, and certainly in the environment that we're in right now, where we're growing revenue at about 30% in the first quarter a little over that. Certainly, it's a good environment to keep driving improvement in the operating ratio may be above those longer-term averages. but over time, that's certainly part of the focus is to continue with that same type of mentality with our yield management philosophy.
Jon Chappell
Got it. Thanks, Adam. Follow up for Greg. Last quarter, you specifically called out some of the issues you've had with some of your suppliers, being unable to get the equipment that you would have liked to have to grow and maybe some of the elevated maintenance expense associated with that. But given how late your CapEx was in 1Q vis-Ã -vis your full year number, are you expecting some of these supplier constraints to kind of lift so you have a very back end loaded spend and get the equipment that you're looking for by the end of the year?
Greg Gantt
Yes, I'm not sure it's going to get a whole lot better. I mean, the equipment that we had planned to receive this year was planned to be delivered later in the year than we would normally take it. Typically, we would start taking trucks, especially late in the first quarter on through the early fall. And then the delivery was pretty much -- deliveries would pretty much be over. We would have what we have purchased for that calendar, particular calendar year and this year, itâs just, it's a lighter build from the get-go. That's what we were told. So that's the difference. It's just coming a little bit later. We're getting a little bit less than we had hoped to get and we're getting a little -- getting it later.
Operator
The next question comes from Jack Atkins with Stephens.
Jack Atkins
Okay. Great. Good morning, Greg. Good morning, Adam. Thanks for taking my questions. So I guess maybe to start out, Adam, if we could go back to your April commentary for a moment, obviously, there are a lot of changes taking place in the freight markets kind of broadly. I would just maybe curious if you could kind of comment on April, relative to March so far, and how it's trending versus either your expectations for April because you kind of - we're kind of going into the month or just relatively normal seasonality. Just sort of curious if you can maybe kind of give us an update there on how the month has trended versus plan.
Adam Satterfield
Yes, I mean a continuation of strong revenue growth. 28% is that where we are continuing to see strong yield performance, which that has certainly continued throughout the first quarter and same types of trends into April, for sure. So it's a reflection of our ability to continue to win market share. We talked about it earlier that as we continue to have conversations with our customers and with our sales team, where we continue to get positive feedback as it relates to demand for our service, and many of these conversations center on the lack of general capacity within LTL. And LTL is different from truckload, and I think a lot of shippers have seen the value of LTL.
And certainly the e-commerce effect on supply chains, there's been movement of freight within LTL that we believe will stay and we believe we'll continue to see tailwinds over time for the industry and we think we can be the biggest participant in winning share as that industry continues to grow much like we've been the biggest share win over the last 10 years. So certainly, that's our plan is to keep investing ahead of growth and keep delivering service value that's better than anyone else in our industry. We've got an unmatched value proposition and our customers continue to respond to that. And so that'll be our focus is to continue delivering best-in-class service and making sure we've got the capacity to support our customersâ growth.
Jack Atkins
Okay, now that makes sense. And that's great to hear on April. So I guess maybe for my follow-up question. Just kind of going back to Jon's point on operating ratio and sort of thinking about seasonality into the second quarter, typically over the last couple of years, you guys have seen between 350 to 400 basis points of sequential improvement 1Q to 2Q. Adam, is there anything to kind of keep in mind as we sort of think about this year, in particular, moving from the first quarter to the second quarter? And do you think that type of normal seasonality is the right way to kind of think about it, and that would imply an operating ratio in the upper 60s. So just sort of curious if you can maybe give us some thoughts on that?
Adam Satterfield
Sure. Certainly, in the first quarter, when you look at some of the sequential changes that we had from 4Q, we outperformed what the normal seasonality was, and what we talked about our target was going to be coming into the fourth quarter - or first quarter rather from the fourth. And some of the benefits that we saw really a variance from the 10-year trend were in our miscellaneous expenses, those costs were lower, those normally are about 0.5%. They were lower, and we got some benefit we normally see an increase. They are general supplies and expenses also were favorable to our longer term trend. And some of those reflect control over discretionary spending, like we talked about.
And in some other things, we're just, there's times where you get some favorability. And especially on those miscellaneous expenses and other times where it could go the other way, it's usually 0.5% plus or minus. So we'd expect some of these items that potentially could increase. And I would just say if you kind of go back to the fourth quarter and look at seasonality from four to first and then second, that would have put our operating ratios just above a 70. But I can tell you, we'd be pleased with that. But we're really focused on being able to see an OR that starts with a six. So anything that starts with a six is going to be good by us.
Operator
And the next question comes from Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo.
Unidentified Analyst
Hi, guys, James on for Alison, actually, just to clarify that. The previous question new expense, you expect both those to normalize moving forward, and they're not necessarily was a reset in this quarter in terms of those expense levels?
Adam Satterfield
Are you talking about the general supplies and expenses in the miscellaneous expenses?
Unidentified Analyst
Correct.
Adam Satterfield
Like I said, the miscellaneous generally is around 0.5% and it was at 0.2% of revenue in the first quarter. So we would expect that to move back to where it's historically trended. Now, again, it's not to say that some of the favorable trends that we saw in the first quarter couldn't repeat, there's a lot of elements that go into that miscellaneous expense, but it's more normalized around that 0.5% and then certainly in some of the things in the general supplies and expenses, we could continue to see some increases there as well. But no specific guidance, if you will to say what that's going to be, but wouldn't be unexpected to see that increase, if you will.
Unidentified Analyst
Got it, just wanted to clarify, and you'd call out that you had 15% to 20% capacity in terms of service and repairs. And you also had some issues with the equipment deliveries. But overall, how much capacity do you think you do have in your network at the moment across sort of the three metrics you've tracked, or you've encouraged us to track around employees, trucks and service centers? Do you actually have capacity to take on incremental volume from here?
Adam Satterfield
Certainly, that's our expectation is to continue to produce growth. And the piece of the capacity equation that you always have to look at is on the service center side, it takes doors to process freight within LTL. And so that is the more determinant figure in terms of how much from the levels where we currently are that we can continue to grow and we generally like to have somewhere 20% to 25% excess capacity. So our CapEx plan this year includes about $300 million to further expand the capacity of our overall service center network, we vote them to three facilities so far this year. And we've got more that are slated, as we proceed through the year to keep expanding the number of service centers and some of those dollars are increasing doors, and existing locations as well. Now, when it comes to the people side of the equation in the fleet, much like you've seen in our numbers over the last couple of years, the lever that we pull there is we have to use purchase transportation if we need to supplement one or the other of those pieces of the capacity equation. And certainly we've stepped up the increased use of purchase transportation, we were actually pleased to see that the outsource miles that we had in the first quarter have actually trended down versus where we were in just the fourth quarter of last year. So we're continuing to make progress there. As we continue to add people to our OD family, we had an 18.5% increase in the number of full time employees. So we're continuing to be successful there and attracting new people to our business and retaining those that we already have. And then we're continuing. So it's a balance of the capacity of our fleet. As Greg mentioned in prepared comments, there's multiple ways to do that we're having to hang on to some of the older equipment, we will get some relief later in the year, we hope with deliveries of what's been ordered, if you will. But again, we can use purchase transportation as needed to supplement there. So I think we've got those pieces covered. And we're continuing to give 99% on time service performance with the claims ratio between 0.1% and 0.2%. So it's best-in-class service, despite the significant volume of growth and processing significant growth on top of the growth that we had last year.
Operator
And the next question comes from Chris Wetherbee with Citigroup.
Chris Wetherbee
Hey, thanks, morning. So Adam, maybe we can talk a little bit about yields and sort of how you maybe see that playing out over the next couple of quarters, I think we're starting to hit some of the tougher comps when we look at revenue per hundredweight ex fuel starting in the second quarter, I guess maybe two questions here first, as a step up to the comp kind of happened immediately in April. So is that sort of the trigger as you move from 1Q to 2Q, we're already beginning to lap those are more challenging comp. I guess the second part bigger picture piece of the question would be just how you think about sort of the pricing environment, your ability to sort of continue to get price, you talked about inflation being 4.5% to 5%. So presumably, you're sort of targeting somewhere in that called 6% to 6.5% maybe 7% range? Can you just talk a little bit about how you're thinking about it?
Adam Satterfield
Yes, certainly the increases that we need in the first half of this year are going to be higher, just like we talked about the expectations on our inflation. We started seeing really the inflation pick up in the middle of last year. And so as contracts are maturing then we were having to start asking for more. We look at the current environment as those mature and what we're seeing and what we expect and we're always making predictions for multiple things, what our volumes are going to be as well as our costs and what our customersâ needs are, but certainly started seeing an acceleration in some of those renewals in the back half of last year. And those need to continue as we move through the first half, but we are starting to get some normalization on some of the weight per shipment trends. At this point, our weight per shipment is flat with where we were last year, we've seen a decreased weight per shipment over the last year or so, as well as increase in the length of haul. So both of those changes in mix have been supporting that overall reported yield number and making it look stronger than just the core increases that we're getting. But we continue to target cost plus, that's been our long-term pricing philosophy. It's been consistent, and one that our customers know and they can understand and we'll continue to execute on that thing, same type of philosophy as we progress through the year. But with some of those mix metrics normalizing, when you just look at kind of normalized trainings, it would if you look at kind of normal seasonality, if you will just sequentially increases from this point forward, starts coming down the year-over-year starts getting to the higher single digits to kind of mid-single digits and eventually normalizing if you will, but certainly right now we're able to get increases that are covering our cost inflation. And I think you can see that in our numbers.
Chris Wetherbee
Okay. That's very helpful. I appreciate that. And you mentioned that the weight per shipments been picking up sequentially here after I think bottom income in the third quarter, should we likely to be sort of up on a year-over-year basis as we move forward?
Adam Satterfield
Well, right now, like I said, we're flat. So as we progress through the second quarter, then we could have things just sort of hold steady, if you will, from a mix standpoint, then certainly, we would start seeing some increase. And that's kind of the point of, you might start seeing the reverse of what we did last year where the mix change puts a little bit of pressure on that reported revenue per hundredweight, certainly in the third quarter, that was our low watermark, I think we're at 1,538 pounds, on average, in the third quarter of last year. Right now we're trending somewhere in the 1,575. So between 1,515 and 1,600 pounds, but it's been a little bit heavier on that scale over the last few months.
Operator
And the next question comes from Scott Group with Wolfe Research.
Scott Group
Hey, thanks. Good morning. Adam, I just want to clarify just a couple things that 28% increase in revenue in April, is it anyway just directionally to break that down between fuel and tonnage and sort of underlying yields. And then I was also just a little confused about your commentary around the second quarter about normal seasonality is a 70 something but you're hoping for 60 something I just -- I wasn't, I was all confused so and you can help there.
Adam Satterfield
Alright, I'll try to clarify that first. So just talk about our revenue growth. And we don't want to necessarily give the details, we will wait and let the month settle out. But like I kind of referenced earlier in March, we saw revenue per hundredweight excluding the fuel that was up about 9%. And that's about the same year-over-year change that we're seeing from a fuel, we never really get into breaking down fuel contributions. But the average price per gallon in March is about the same in April. And so it's averaging about a little over five, about $5.11, $5.12. So there's about 62% increase in that DOE price per gallon in March, and the same type of increase that we're seeing in April. So we'll have similar contributions, if you will, there. So their overall yield continues to show considerable strength and the comparison start looking a little bit different, if you will, on the volume side. And when you look at last year, and what the revenue growth was. We had total revenue growth of about 16% in the first quarter of last year, and it was 47% in the second quarter. So those will certainly change as we progress through the second quarter, the comparisons get a little bit tougher, which is why we're extremely pleased to see the strong revenue growth at 28% in April but and you'll continue to see contributions like that the yield is certainly a driving a lot of that revenue growth for us right now, but seeing very solid volume performance as well. In terms of the operating ratio, I don't want to give specific guidance, per se. But my point was, we certainly had some favorability in the first quarter.
I mentioned the general supplies and expenses and the miscellaneous expenses, and that those could revert back. So there's certainly could be some pressure on that normal sequential change that we see from the first to second quarter. One other thing that was beneficial was we had lower fringe cost in the first quarter than what I expected for the year is in that fringe cost as a percent of our salaries and wages. So I would expect that to kind of normalize back to where I thought it would be for the year. So there may be a little bit of pressure on a couple of those items, time will tell and we'll see. But my point was, if you just took normal seasonality from the fourth quarter, certainly we had big outperformance in 1Q but if you do took normal seasonality from the fourth quarter, and ran it through to the second, that would have put our operating ratio right in a 70.2. And we'll see that would imply less seasonal improvement than what we'd normally expect and what the point of the matter was, if we operate anywhere that starts with a six, if it's a 69.9, we will certainly be very excited to see that kind of number. We're sitting here like Burt Reynolds and Jerry Reed trying to do something that they said couldn't be done. And we think that we can get it done, but certainly, if it comes out but it says 70.1 or 70.2. That's producing very strong, profitable growth as well. But nevertheless, not throwing necessarily a specific target out there, but just saying what could be done with some of the numbers and how they might normally train it.
Scott Group
Okay, yes, most of the others get excited about starting with an eight. You made a comment about LTL is different than truckload so I'm guessing the LTL is very different than spot truckload. But there's a lot of focus on spot rates right now. What -- how does slowing following spot rates impact in any way your tonnage outlook, your pricing outlook?
Adam Satterfield
Well, from a tonnage standpoint, that was the point we wanted to make was that what's going on in truckload right now, we already last year, and taken a lot of the heavier weighted shipments that might be considered spillover freight in prior periods and had worked those out of our system. So we don't have those same pressures. And I don't think many of the other LTL carriers do either. Just looking at some of the statistics. I think freight demand had been so solid and influx of freight into the LTL world that many carriers and certainly us we can speak to, specifically, we're just focused on long-term LTL freight not something that might be more transactional. Here today gone tomorrow type of thing if truckload capacity loosened up so we're not seeing the same type of pressures and not really hearing about it from an overall competitive landscape either, that there's some movement of freight going back into the truckload world, but certainly something that will continue to pay attention to. And we're talking very frequently with customers in our sales team, but, again, that's consistent feedback that we're receiving from all parties is that demand continues to be solid. And certainly numbers are what they are. And part of the conversation in our prepared remarks talking about 10 year trends and so forth. We've doubled our market share over the last 10 years. And that doesn't always come in a linear fashion. So we might have a month where volumes underperform for our monthly period, our 10 year average trends and that's certainly not something to get overly concerned about. And we saw some of that in the first quarter we underperformed if you just look purely from a 10 year average sequential standpoint, on the volume side, but we produced a lot of revenue growth and good profit growth as a result. So we continue to be encouraged by the overall environment and the feedback that we're hearing from customers and our sales team and want to continue to do what it takes to take advantage of the volume flows that may come our way this year.

And our next question comes from Jordan Alliger with Goldman Sachs.
Jordan Alliger
Yes. Hi, I'm curious, I realizing that things are very strong today. If they do or where to go into a slower economic situation later this year into next year, maybe negative growth, given the headcount increases you've had and obviously wage increases across the sector. I mean, how flexible or nimble these think you guys would be sort of in the other direction, in terms of pulling things back? And can you with wage increases and headcount. Thanks.
Greg Gantt
Jordan, we've done this in the past, I mean, I don't think anybody likes to manage through a downturn or recession or whatever you want to call it, but we've done it in the past. It's surely not a lot of fun, and you have to make hard decisions at times, but we've managed through the worst recession ever in 2009, at least in my pretty lengthy career, it's probably the worst ever, we managed through that fairly well. Then we did it again in â16, and through a flat year, and in â19. So we've geared up, then we gear down, and in gear back up, and this business is up and down, it always has been, but if we have to manage in a downturn, I've got all the confidence in the world, we can manage through that. As Adam mention though so far so good this year, our trends are good, our feedback from customers are, is very strong, we've had two of our top 10 accounts in the building in the last couple of weeks. And they're both very positive on their business and their customers. And these were logistics companies, by the way. They're huge, and they manage an awful lot of dollars. And their outlook is very strong at this point in time. And I think our standing with these particular accounts and with our accounts, in general, our standing is better than ever. And at this point in time, we're not thinking about a downturn. If we have to, we will, but that's not where we are today.

And the next question comes from Todd Fowler with KeyBanc Capital Markets.
Todd Fowler
Hey, great, thanks, and good morning. So I wanted to ask on where you think you're at from a headcount growth standpoint. I know you've had success in the adding headcount. But it's been about above tonnage and shipment growth now for the past couple of quarters. Get some comments in the release about continuing to add headcount in 2Q. Do you think you're getting to the point where headcount is caught up with where your tonnage levels are? How do you think about continued headcount growth into the back half of the year?
Greg Gantt
Yes, Todd, I think we are, I think we have pretty much caught up, we're, we still have some needs in some places, but we're much closer than we've been probably in the best shape we've been in over a year. So happy with that happy with where we are. And we'll just have to see how the volume trends continue. If we continue on our current growth trajectory, then we will have to continue to add some as our seasonality dictates, but I think those needs will be fewer, certainly than they were in the last year so. But yes, it's -- we're in a better spot and feel pretty good about our standing today. And that wouldn't be a bad thing to see that continue to level off a little bit.
Todd Fowler
Yes, I know, understood, that's a good comment, that's helpful there. And then Greg just to follow up on your prepared remarks, you had a lot of comments around shippers really realizing the value of the LTL service proposition. I guess I'm curious are you seeing any shift in your mix as far as kind of your core customer base, and I know, it would just be around the edges. You're not a big wholesale shift, but kind of different shippers using LTL, relative to where you've been historically. And when you think about the tonnage growth that you've been experiencing, do you think that most of that's because of your available capacity, or is there something else within the industry that's driving that? Thanks.
Greg Gantt
Todd, not that I know of, not at all, I think it's discontinued growth from existing accounts. Certainly, we continue to take on new business. We have a very significant group of sales folks working out there every day so we did continue to gain some new business from the reports that I'm seeing, but no normal growth from existing customers, I think just the continued confidence that they have in us and the service performance that we've given them in the past and they like it, their customers need that, their supply chain, as Adam mentioned, supply chains are challenged in putting that product on the shelf is more important now than probably ever.

And the next question comes from Ravi Shankar with Morgan Stanley.
Ravi Shankar
Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Couple of follow ups, one to the kind of downturn planning question. I'm sure you guys are aware that most of your peers and a lot of investors have been trying to figure out what your secret sauce has been for years? And why there isn't one answer. I think one of the big elements is your continued kind of investments, almost irrespective of the cycle. But I just wanted to get a sense of what benchmarks you guys would look at in terms of turning the wick up or down on the incremental growth plans. A, if there is a downturn, are you going to put your foot down and actually accelerate investments? Or, again, what are some of the metrics you'd look at to start pulling back?
Adam Satterfield
Well, I think you've got to look at past performance to a degree to see how we react. And as Greg mentioned earlier, we've taken the opportunity in the past, and some of those slower periods, like you mentioned, to in some ways, accelerate our investments. And I mentioned earlier that we're probably a little bit behind we are at 15% to 20% excess capacity, we like being that sort of 20% to 25%, on average, and we're a little bit behind that target range is given the significant volume growth that we've had. So we look through a longer term lens, if you will, and try to project out where we think our market share and our volumes might be in the next 5 to 10 years, is not just always in the here and now. So certainly you can execute when it comes to real estate investments in a very short period of time. Oftentimes, and we didn't necessarily see this in the last slow cycle in â19 like we thought we might have. But in prior periods in downturns, we've seen some opportunities come our way that were attractive investments from land opportunities, existing service center opportunities. So certainly if something becomes available, and an area that's on our long-term roadmap for where we want to go, and then yes we would take advantage of something like that. But it's just always sort of looking at what's in front of you, if you will, from an opportunity standpoint, and then us thinking about the longer term opportunity, where we want to be, where we think we need to have capacity to support the continued growth within our network and to be able to keep our service metrics where are they are today.
Ravi Shankar
Got it. That's good color. And just a follow up on the topic of keeping an eye on the long term and growth investments. There have been a number of important developments in the past the commercialization of autonomous trucks, and obviously, the pressure on most companies to kind of strengthen their ESG footprint with electrification is growing as well. We'd love to get an update from you guys on kind of what you're seeing out there, what your investment plans are in both these technologies, and maybe kind of the what would the rollout path looks like, especially if you're going to invest in a downturn?
Adam Satterfield
Well, we've certainly is one, we've just recently disclosed our first ESG sustainability report. So we were proud to get that out. And I think that was a means to show some of the long-term improvements that we've made over time with operating efficiencies, and overall improvements in our miles for gallons and so forth. And we'll continue to track towards some of the goals that we have internally to continue to improve those metrics. And one of the key pillars of our foundation for success is continuous improvement. And that means multiple things, continuous improvement in multiple areas, but as it relates specifically to electric vehicles, and autonomous and so forth, we'll continue to stay engaged with manufacturers to see what's coming down the line. We would like to try to test some of the equipment and we actually ordered some equipment, but we're still waiting on the delivery of the truck. And so I think that goes to some of the pressures that the OEMs have in terms of what actually is being produced and is planned to be produced in the near term. Weâll steal from all the feedback we get from specs and capabilities, don't believe that electric trucks, as they exist today, really fit the operating model of an LTL network, at least how we run our business. But we felt like we wanted to have a seat at the table. And that was why we put an order in to get something and actually put it in place to operate and to be able to give true feedback in terms of what the limitations may or may not be so. But we'll continue to stay engaged with all of our suppliers in that regard to see as things change, and where it may make sense to try to integrate some of that technology into our network as it makes sense or not.

And the next question comes from Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank.
Amit Mehrotra
Oh, great, thanks. Appreciate it. So I just had a couple of questions. Adam, just clarification, did you give April tonnage sequentially from March versus seasonality and year-over-year in April. Could you give that if you haven't had already?
Adam Satterfield
No, we havenât provided the detail consistent with what we've done in the past. We'll give it with our 10-Q. But just gave where we're trending from an overall revenue standpoint, and then gave a little extra color on kind of what our yield trends are doing.
Amit Mehrotra
Okay, fine. And then I guess bigger picture questions, you guys are knocking the cover off the ball. On many metrics, your stock is down 25% this year, I don't want to make too big of a deal of near term or midterm stock movements. But everybody's debating right now what the peak to trough earnings declined to look like in a very tough macro scenario. And I think part of that reflects the trough to peak has been such so robust for OD and many other companies as well. So I guess the question is, if I look at the industry, the industry has done a tremendous job of understanding its cost structure a little bit, pricing rationally relative to that, those investments they've made and understanding their cost structure. So do you think that the industry from a pricing discipline perspective is just better than it's ever been because of some of those specific investments? And do you think the price, there's risk in that in a downturn that the industry pricing just breaks down? Just talk about how the pricing discipline for the industry is today versus how it's been kind of at any time in the past?
Adam Satterfield
Well, I certainly think it's been more disciplined. And you can get back to 2019. And, in particular, the second quarter of 2020, as well. And then that was a pretty steep drop for everyone from a revenue standpoint, and no one knew how long of a drop we were going to be in. But I think that there was a lot of discipline that was shown and I think it gets back to, there's certainly a lot of value that an LTL carrier can offer. And there's a lot of expense to running into expanding on LTL carriers network. And we've certainly have seen that over the years, we talk a lot about the costs of expanding our real estate network, the land costs, facilities where we have to lease some of the rent rates have almost become prohibitively expensive, but something I thought that way about a couple of years ago may now look like a bargain. So it's one of those things where we've got to continue to build that type of cost escalation into our pricing plan. And I think we'll continue to certainly see our numbers and our philosophy, no change with respect to the cost plus pricing that we've displayed over the years. And I think that it's likely that we'll continue to, we've seen discipline from the other carriers and wouldn't expect any change in that regard. And the industry now, a lot certainly been written lately about what's going on in truckload but you've have almost 70% of the LTL revenue that's in publicly traded companies now. And so it doesn't take long to see what everyone is seeing and doing. And certainly probably more important that to see what actually is going on for management teams versus just reading reports off of the internet. That's sensationalized maybe a little bit more but, but I don't think you can all necessarily extrapolate what you're seeing in some of those reports to the LTL world.

The next question comes from Ken Hoexter with Bank of America.
Ken Hoexter
Hey, great, good morning, Greg or Adam, can you maybe thoughts on the impact of purchase transportation on quality controls expense and what is now outsourced? As you talked about maybe growing it a bit all the way I think Adam, you mentioned it was down in first quarter versus fourth quarter. But it sounds like you were -- you needed to scale that to meet your growth targets going forward?
Adam Satterfield
Yes, certainly, we were able to use the purchase transportation in an increasing manner as we went through, mainly 2021, started stepping up a little bit in response to the acceleration in volumes that we saw on the back half of 2020. And speaking of sequential accelerations, just to be able to keep pace with the growth and expectations from our customers. But we've got good carriers that we've used to supplement mainly within our line haul operation. And it's overall, still pretty minimal in terms of the outsourced miles. And certainly, we saw the cost increasing, if you will, is that rate environment was increasing. But we were able to work those third parties into our network and keep our service metrics high, while responding to significant volume growth from customers last year. And we saw maybe a slight uptick in our claims ratio that was probably more or somewhat reflective of using third party truckload carriers versus our 20 and 28 foot top operation, and all the claims prevention tools that we have. But when I say it uptick, and uptick from 0.1 something to 0.16 that just round it to 0.2, so we're talking very minimal increase there. And that's part of the overall value that we provide to our customers. And Greg mentioned it earlier in his prepared comments that part of our value proposition is having capacity. When you look through prior cycles, look through 2017 and 2018, we're able to grow with our customers right now. And when you look at the other carriers, at least the public areas in the back half of last year were pretty flattish from a volume standpoint. So we're able to come in and demonstrate value, not only with the service quality that we offer, but being able to provide capacity when no one else can. And so that takes investment, it takes investment in real estate, a fleet and our people to make sure we've got that flex capacity. And certainly we always try to stay ahead of the game as best we can in that regard, but certainly pleased that we're able to deliver that for our customers.
Ken Hoexter
Great, thanks for that. And I guess for my follow up, let me just start off with the premise, you talked about doubling your share. But I guess one or two of your public peers were kind of closing service centers and kind of maybe shrinking their business. And that's kind of changed, right. So most of your peers are now adding service centers and doors, everybody's kind of set new targets out there. Do you still see the LTL market is structurally growing share within the entire trucking market? And then if so, I think a lot of demand questions coming to you now is where do you see it first, right? Where do you see when you see a roll is it the consumer? Do you not see it because ecommerce growth has changed that within the dynamic that you're still growing and taking? Sure so you wouldn't see that impact, maybe just set the stage for the dynamic of what goes on in a market these days, relatively within the LTL market?
Adam Satterfield
Well, we've talked about this before, but in our business, the way we try to manage and project out, we always have a baseline forecast for the year. And then we have scenarios with growth above that baseline and in scenarios where the volumes are below that baseline and we try to have a plan for both. We have that baseline plan and then how we're going to execute in either side of that scenario and all we can do is continuously look at our numbers and have continuous conversations with customers. And certainly we've had years where we've been above and below our baseline scenarios and you just make operational decisions from that point forward. And part of that is the way we structure our network we give each of our service center managers has got control in terms of managing their headcount and running their operation as needed in terms of adding to or are pulling back on some of the additions that they're making, depending on what the environment is like and but it just takes constant communication between us and our customer base. And oftentimes, a lot of that is communication with many of our third party logistics, customers, six of our top 10 largest customers are three PLs, and there are a fair amount of overall business and they generally have a read on what's going on. And if there's mode shifts and other things, and we still get favorable feedback from them with respect to the expectations for volumes this year. And so that kind of goes into our baseline and maybe why some of our conversation and thinking might seem a little bit different than what others might be talking about, with respect to overall transportation this year.
Ken Hoexter
Great, and your thought would, just to wrap that up, the thought within the LTL market? Do you still see it structurally taking share within â in the trucking side? Just understand it like yes.
Adam Satterfield
Yes, we do. I feel like it will continue to grow. And right now we've got when you look at all the industrial numbers, those are all favorable, for sure. And we're seeing good growth, our revenue growth in the first quarter was pretty balanced between both our industrial and our retail related business. We're continuing to see consumer spending. But irrespective of that, there's freight demand for LTL carriers and shippers that this e-commerce effect on supply chains that are leveraging the network that we've built out in moving freight, if it's a manufacturer, that is moving freight, in yesteryear, it may have been one full truckload of goods to a regional distribution center, that may be 10 different fulfillment centers in that same region. And we can build one truckload basically, one full van of goods with that same manufacturer, but they're now leveraging our network as we distribute those goods throughout our system and to that ultimate fulfillment center. And so we think that type of change will continue to drive volumes into the LTL industry. And I think that given the investments that we've made, and the requirements too from the big box retailers for their vendors, shipping product in most have on time in full or must arrive by date, type of programs. And certainly, it's a focus on the old time deliveries and no damages. And then you've got the best metrics like we do. That's how we can add further value to our customers by making sure that they show well on their vendor scorecards with their customers. And that's been a piece of the market share that we've won over the last 10 years. And we think that that trend will continue going forward.
Operator
And the next question comes from Tom Wadewitz with UBS.
Tom Wadewitz
Yes, it's Tom. Sorry, I was on mute there. I guess a little bit of follow up on that last one what, the kind of consumer goods spending and potential weakness seems like a key point of concern. So what is your mix look like broad brush? I know sometimes it's hard to be overly precise. But if you say, well, the 2016 cycle, when we saw weakness, we had kind of x amount of consumer and y amount industrial, and then maybe in 2019. And today, has it skewed a lot more towards consumer? Or how do you think about at a high level that mix of your book, that's if you want to put it in industrial and consumer, or if you want to do include other buckets.
Adam Satterfield
I mean, it's still more weighted to industrial than retail, about 55% to 60% of our revenue is industrial related and 25% to 30% is retail related, but it's -- that's probably moved up the spectrum, closer to that 30% threshold. And I mentioned that we've seen a lot of good growth in our -- with our retail customers. And we have I mean, that's been a big part of the story. But we continue to see good growth and market share with our industrial customers as well. And there have been periods where that retail was growing a bit faster. But both are growing for us. And we're still seeing good share there. So it's that retail component has crept up a little bit, but our good industrial businesses has grown as well has continue to somewhat keep pace.
Tom Wadewitz
Are you hearing, I don't know if this is the type of, if you have clear input from customers on this, but are you hearing a difference in the outlook between those two customer segments or the consumer related customers more cautious and the industrial side is more aggressive? And I guess, I think, Greg, you commented on inventories too that you thought inventories were still light. I don't know, if there's a difference in kind of urgency for industrial versus consumer.
Adam Satterfield
We look at the inventory to sales ratio, and that continues to be low and really reconciles with feedback that we're getting from customers, be it on the retail or the industrial side that inventory balances are lower than what they prefer them to be, we have an awful lot of conversation about the number of back orders that many are dealing with, and in some cases, missed opportunities where they simply haven't had product on the shelf or ready now if it's an online purchase, if you will. And so I think that's something that Greg mentioned earlier, that we're seeing and hearing not only from the customer side, but we were seeing and feeling it from our supplier side as well. So both kind of go hand in hand. And many of our suppliers are also customers. So we're seeing that across the board, if you will. But that's why we think that even I mean, right now, consumer spending continues to be strong, I think, household balance sheets are good. And maybe consumer confidence is not as high as it has been. But we still feel like freight demand can continue for past any type of consumption slowdown, just given the fact that we feel like inventory balances need to be built back up. And we continue to believe that long term we will see a higher inventory to sales ratio than perhaps where we were pre pandemic.
Operator
And the next question comes from Bascome Majors form Susquehanna.
Bascome Majors
Yes, thanks for taking my question, not to beat a dead horse with another hypothetical recession scenario. But it's clear that you don't think there is a structural change to the investment you've been able to invest in, I'm sorry, to the situation you've been able to invest into making a tremendous amount of return over the last 10 years. But I'm curious, what as you think about scenarios, not just the kind of scenario analysis you talked about in a single year, but in that five to 10 year plan, where you're looking, where to invest, and where to buy land, and where to build more capacity? What would it take to maybe change that strategy? Is it seeing less discipline in pricing at your peers? Is it a consistent run of sub seasonal tonnage versus the sheer gain you've gotten historically? I'm just curious what you would have to see to actually make a change in the way that you approach the market price long term. Thank you.
Tom Wadewitz
Bascome, if again a big if, and I know it's a hypothetical. But if we saw a major downturn of some kind, and all of a sudden, we had excessive capacity, maybe we would look to do something different. But to tell you the truth as Adam mentioned earlier, if sometimes in a downturn, it provides the best opportunity for you to go out and do some things in certain markets that are extremely difficult to get them done. And that may present an opportunity for us and give us that very, very difficult place that we desperately need. So I hate to talk too much about hypotheticals. But we'll certainly take advantage of the market if it provides some opportunities for us. We've got to be optimistic. I've talked about it in the past, how difficult it is now to acquire land in certain parts of the country, how difficult it is to get building started and whatnot. And I think we'd be terribly remiss if we sat back and said old things that really slowed down and we shouldn't do this. And if you can flip the switch and build a facility in six months, or even a year, that's one thing, but when we know in some of these markets, it's two, three and four and five years to get something accomplished. You've got to be opportunistic when those opportunities are there, you've got to strike and you've got to take advantage of them. So I'm not sure that anything would drastically change our outlook and our strategy at this point, I think we've had a fair amount of success. I think you'd agree with that, that what we've done it's worked. And we've continued to put ourselves in a good position to take share. And honestly, I don't see that changing, if we were at 30% share something crazy, but we're still at a 12% market share. So we think there's still a lot of upside for growth from our standpoint. And, again, I think it's critical that we take advantage, when that opportunity provides.
Adam Satterfield
Just add a little bit more color to that to reinforce the point, if we had not made the decision to invest in 2016, we wouldn't have been able to take advantage of the revenue opportunities that we had in â17, and â18. And the same is true in 2019. If we had listened to everything that we had read at that point, and had pulled back and not continue to execute on our CapEx plan, then we wouldn't have been able to enjoy the growth that we saw last year and what we're seeing today, so it takes investment during those slower times to kind of buildup that excess capacity to be able to participate in these really strong market environments. And I think that's why you've seen us have a little different performance, it's a different strategy. But certainly, we've been able to participate on the upside, the market swing more so than anyone. And so as Greg said, we feel like we've got a really long runway for growth ahead of us. And it's just going to continue to take that continuous investment cycle, whether we're in the middle of the market, upturn or if things are slower. That's just something we've got to maintain our focus on and make sure that we're continuing to expand the network overall.

And the next question comes from Tyler Brown with Raymond James.
Tyler Brown
Hey, good morning, guys. Hey, so we've talked to some developers and it sounds like labor materials are difficult zoning environment, is actually capping some square footage growth in the broader industrial real estate market. Obviously, you earmark $300 million in CapEx on real estate. But Greg, you kind of talked about it, but how confident are you that you will actually be able to spend that this year?
Greg Gantt
Well, I'll be honest with you, Tyler, I am maybe a little more concerned, we're going to have opportunities and exceed that number. But we'll just have to see, we've gotten an awful lot of projects in play. So we'll just have to see what opportunities present themselves. And I can tell you at the price align nowadays that we can reach that budget pretty doggone quick. So it's a challenge, but I think we'll get there. Honestly, I think we'll be all over.
Tyler Brown
Okay, so that actually kind of plays into my second question is a difficult question. But I think it's a really important one. But how much would you say the cost to build a like for like door today is versus pre COVID? I mean, how much is that increased just with all the material costs increases? Just anything directionally would be helpful?
Greg Gantt
Yes, it's relatively significant. I'm not talking about properties now. I'm just talking about materials. I did see something from our real estate folks recently, and it's probably in the 20% range, give or take, some materials are more than that some less but the cost of everything, be it concrete, steel, , any and all materials has definitely increased relatively significant than the last year or two since the pandemic. Everything is up there.
Tyler Brown
Okay, that's very helpful. And then, Adam, quick question, just clarification. So does the propane that your forklifts consume qualify for CNG tax credits? And if so, didn't those credits go away year-over-year and was that a large drag in Q1 or is that non material?
Adam Satterfield
You're very perceptive to asking something like that. But that credit did go away. [Multiple Speakers] that credit has sort of come and gone at different times. But at this point, I think it's gone. We'll see if that comes back or not.

Unidentified Analyst
Good morning, guys. This is Matt on for Bruce. Thank you for squeezing us in here. And Greg, congrats on the quarter. With respect to China's COVID lockdowns and potential for some increased port congestion, later this summer, given some CBA negotiations, we were curious if you guys are seeing any customer change in their ordering or perhaps contract and patterns in order to maybe get in front of this. Thank you.
Greg Gantt
Yes, Bruce, I can't comment on that. I have not heard that. I expect that will be an issue if it continues. But yes, we're -- what we're hearing from over there it's not good. And if they lockdown Beijing and as long as -- as well as the rest of the port cities that they have already. It's definitely going to be an impact. But I have not heard that not from our sales folks or our customers to this point.
Thank you. And this does conclude the question-and-answer session. I would like to return the floor to Greg Gantt for any closing comments.
