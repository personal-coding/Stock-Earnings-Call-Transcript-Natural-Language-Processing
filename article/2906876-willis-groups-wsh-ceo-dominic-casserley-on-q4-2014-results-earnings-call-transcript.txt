Dominic Casserley
Welcome and thank you for joining our quarterly conference call. I must apologies I am at the tail end of a cold, so we will sound a bit nasally on the call. With me today are John Greene, our Chief Financial Officer; Steve Hearn, our Deputy CEO; Tim Wright, Head of Willis International; and Todd Jones, Head of Willis North America.
Now I want to start our discussion today, by reminding you of the three key components of our value creation strategy. First, we will drive organic profit and cash flow growth through our diversified portfolio of risk advisory, brokerage and benefits businesses, with growth coming from across the Group. We are focused on delivering mid single-digit organic revenue growth. In parallel, we will manage our organic costs to create a healthy gain and organic margin.
Second, we will manage our targeted acquisitions to create value through stronger revenue performance and improved cash flow.
Third, we continue to transform our operational performance with our operational improvement program designed to deliver sustainable cost savings of $300 million from 2018 with a gradual process of cost improvement each year up until then.
We expect that the program will add to our underlying margin -- each year as it starts to do in the fourth quarter or 2014. Combined, these three components will drive cash flow and shareholder value.
Now the reason I remind you of these three components is that in the fourth quarter of the year we saw all three of them in action. First, our 3.6% organic commissions and fees growth outpaced our organic expense growth by 90 basis points and as one would expect, achieving this spread led to good growth in other important metrics, such as operating income, operating margins, net income and ultimately earnings per share.
The second leg of our value creation strategy is inorganic growth. In the fourth quarter we saw the impact of our acquisitions. Our underlying growth, which includes the impact of acquisitions were 7.2%. You can see from that, how the acquisitions as we drive synergies over the next few quarters will continue to drive revenues and profits.
During the course of 2015, you should see greater impact from Max Matthiessen, which closed in the fourth quarter and once it is closed, Miller Insurance Services along with our smaller acquisitions.
Finally, we have the early impact of our operational improvement program, which contributed $11 million of cost savings in the year, an annualized rate of about $34 million.
As the program get its momentum in the next 12 months, its impact will become still more apparent. So in sum, the fourth quarter results exhibited all three components of our value creation strategy in action.
Let me now turn to organic growth. As I just mentioned earlier, Group organic commissions and fees grew 3.6%. The segment results, however, were uneven with one segment International growing spectacularly. While Willis Global was close to flat in some challenging environment and Willis North America was slightly down.
The strength of our diversified model is such that we can deliver performance at the Group level when our business units do not hold the performance evenly at the same time. We have seen that throughout the year. You should expect that in every quarter some businesses will be stronger than others, but we expect that this some will continue to deliver good organic growth.
Let me now give you a little more detail on each of the segments in turn. And first, weâll listen to International. Our International operations led the way this quarter, growing 15.9%, bringing their organic growth rate for the full year to a very good number of 9%.
You know from our press release that this quarterâs result had some tailwinds to rise from adjustments booked in the previous yearâs fourth quarter. But even without that impact, International achieved strong organic growth of 11% in the quarter.
Obviously, the quarterâs results are very pleasing especially given the backdrop of generally low-to-moderate economic growth across many of the regions served by the International segment. We saw a double-digit growth across almost all of our international region in the quarter, with a growth driven by strong new business wins.
Now on this call last quarter, I spoke of the International segments growth trend outpacing general economic growth rates around the globe. This quarterâs results and indeed the yearâs results demonstrate quite clearly that our strong market positions combined with discipline on how and where we compete in each of our markets mean that we can deliver growth of our trend.
Onto Willis North America, North America was down 2.1% in the quarter which brings the segmentâs organic growth from the full year to 2.8%. You may recall that the segment face a headwind in the quarterly comparison caused by the non-recurrence of the $5 million positive revenue recognition adjustments booked last year related to its first alliance business. Excluding that adjustment from last year, North America would have been down by less than 1%.
Now you maybe wondering whether the slight decline in North America in the fourth quarter is the harbinger of future weakness, absolutely not. North Americaâs retention levels remain consistent in the low 90s and new business across most of its practices is strong. We are entering 2015 with a strong pipeline of opportunities which supports our confidence in the business overall.
So weakness in this past quarter was for the most part isolated in two industries, the Real Estate Hospitality Group and Construction. Construction which was down mid single digits was driven by weak surety results and simply less construction project works compared to the prior year period.
We remain confident that Construction is a real strength for Willis North America and indeed all of Willis. Positively, we saw good growth in our financial institutions and service industry practices. And Iâm pleased to say that our two largest product based practices, Human Capital and FINEX grew mid-single digits and high single digit respectively. Both of them also grew solidly for the full year.
Now on to Willis Global where organic commissions and fees were down 0.3% in quarter. For the full year, organic growth was 1.4%. Once again, the quarterâs results were in fact a blend of result across the components of the segment. Willis Re continue to grow solidly despite significant headwinds from soft rates and some reduction in reinsurance purchasing among the largest insurers. Its organic growth was in the mid single digits.
Within the reinsurance business, Willis Re International grew double digits and Willis Re North America grew high single digits, with both continuing to win new business and exhibit strong retention levels. Overall, we were pleased with our reinsurance results in 2014. Innovation, analytics and strong client service have underpinned the business and we remain confident that this will continue despite the difficult market conditions, which we expect to persist for the foreseeable future.
Willis Insurance U.K. declined low-single digits. Our insolvency in real estate businesses were down and two of our largest specialty businesses, P&C and Construction and Transportation weighed on the result. We had commented previously that the fourth quarter would be a difficult comparison for the P&C and Construction business due to a large project recorded in the prior year quarter.
Soft market rates in transportation, which includes Marine, Aviation and Aerospace continued to impact results. Offsetting this was fully growth in our natural resources, FAJS and large accounts businesses. That is a relatively brief overview of our revenues for the quarter. I'm happy to report that weâre making good progress on expense growth and John will take you through that momentarily.
Importantly, lower expense growth coupled with our revenue growth in the quarter has underpinned an improvement in our key underlying metrics this quarter in including EPS up nearly 18%, EBITDA up nearly 12% and margins improved by 100 basis points.
Now, Iâm going to ask John to take you through the numbers in a bit more detail.
John Greene
Thank you, Dominic. Good day to those on the call. I'll be working on the fourth quarter slide deck which is available on the website. Starting at slide three, this is a walkthrough of our earnings, taking you through reported and underlying EPS from the fourth quarter 2013 to the fourth quarter 2014.
The key point on this slide is the impact of positive operating leverage with revenue growth outpacing expense growth, creating a $0.10 positive movement in EPS. This as you know is the first time in 2014 that the business has delivered positive spread in the slides, mid-single-digit organic growth and progress with expense management initiatives.
Also included is a $12 million settlement for book of business in our global segment. There was a comparable $4 million in the prior year. Our reported EPS includes restructuring costs related to the operational improvement program which amounts to $16 million in the quarter.
Turning to slide four which takes you through commission and fee growth by segment. The difference between reported and underlying for each segment is the foreign exchange movements. The difference between underlying and organic is the net impact from acquisitions and disposals.
You can see that FX had a negative impact on Internationals and Global C&F when comparing reported and underlying growth. This was driven principally by the 10% depreciation in the euro against the dollar and the 5% weakening of the sterling.
When you look at Internationalâs underlying results, you see the strong organic growth coupled with the impact of the acquisition of Max Matthiessen, Charles Monat and the IFG business yielding quarter-over-quarter growth of nearly 33%. In North America, the 4.9% decline from the prior year reflects the impact of our portfolio management activity. In the fourth quarter, we sold some non-strategic slow growth offices.
Associated with this, we recognized a $13 million gain in non-operating income. On an organic basis, we expect challenging comparisons given the high growth in the fourth quarter of 2013. However, as Dominic said, we're comfortable with the outlook for 2015.
Moving on to the total expense walk on slide five. Nonetheless, we adjust for $24 million of favorable foreign currency movements in the fourth quarter of 2014. The most significant impact as youâd expect was from the euro and sterling depreciation. But we also saw most other currencies falling against the dollar. Underlying expenses grew by $53 million, of which $33 million was from acquisitions.
You will notice on the slide that for the first time, we've isolated the impact of acquisitions and disposals on our expense base by providing organic numbers. Our organic expense growth was 2.7%. So our cost management initiatives and savings from the operational improvement program are starting to come through in our results.
Slide six provides the similar walk of salary and benefit expense. Underlying S&P grew $50 million or 9.1% to $600 million. This included a $20 million increase from M&A. Excluding M&A, organic S&B was up 5.5%. Looking at the drivers of that growth, organic headcount was up about 1%. Salary increased, contributed 2% to 3% in line with inflation and finally, we saw increased production incentives in International tied to the strong sales growth.
Turning to slide 7, this shows the S&B trend on an underlying and organic basis by quarter. There are three important points here. First, on an organic basis, the first half or the second half S&B is essentially flat. The second point is simply that our 2014 acquisitions added about $25 million to S&B.
The final point is related to our headcount manager. Organic FTEs were up around 1%. Onshore FTEs including the impact of acquisitions are flat and offshore FTEs in Mumbai increased by 200 during the year. When we look forward to 2015, we should expect to see a continued focus in FTE manager.
So you are aware. There will be FTE movements from M&A activity. We will also see a temporary increase in FTEs, as a result of parallel running of rolls that are being relocated as part of the operational improvement program. The costs associated with the parallel running is included in the estimated program spend figures we provided previously.
So, onto our operational improvement program on slide 8, the full year 2014 spend of $36 million came in slightly below our last year estimate of $40 million. This was a result of lower than anticipated severance costs. Savings of $11 million are ahead of our $8 million estimate.
Those savings were largely driven by headcount reduction initiatives related to organizational restructuring. Very little of the savings came from moving rolls to lower cost geographies. As I indicated in my FTE comments, the relocation of rolls will be a significant element of our 2015 work streams.
You can see that weâve updated our key operational metrics for the program as promised. The metrics are the ratio of FTEs and higher cost versus lower cost locations, the ratios of square footage of real estate per FTEs and the ratio of desks per FTEs. The improvements are modest but it is still early in the program. What is important is that they are all headed in the right direction. Finally, as we reflect on the overall progress, we are maintaining our estimates with a total spend of savings. But we are very pleased with the progress today.
Now, before I move on to EBITDA, I wanted to point out that we have included in the appendix a slide showing other operating expenses and the non-operating items. These are fairly self explanatory but I will be happy to answer questions as part of Q&A.
Turning to slide 9, underlying EBITDA was $193 million in the fourth quarter, up more than 11%. For the full year, underlying EBITDA of $829 million was up little over 1%. While this is not where we want it to be, you know the story, solid revenue growth largely offset by expense growth. We anticipate that going forward, mid-single-digit organic revenue growth, supplemented by M&A and strong cost management discipline will allow us to drive EBITDA growth at a better pace.
Turning to our corporate uses of cash and cash on the balance sheet on slide 10, in 2014, we invested in our future through M&A and return capital to shareholders. This included $241 million of M&A, $213 million of share buyback, $113 million of CapEx and $210 million of dividends, a 9% increase from the prior year. This represents outlay for close to $800 million, an increase of nearly $450 million from the prior year.
All of these reduced our cash balance by just $161 million, bringing it to $635 million at year end. For 2015, our Board approved a 3.3% increase in the dividend, together with share buybacks of up to $175 million. The intention of this buyback is the same as 2014 to offset the increase in share count from the exercise of employee stock options.
Turning to slide 11, here is a report card on the progress weâve made in 2014 towards our medium-term goals. We delivered mid-single-digit organic C&F growth of 3.8%. Given the deliberate investments we made in late 2013, we did not achieve a 70 basis point of positive spreads in the year. But we did made good progress in the second half and achieved 90 basis points of positive spread in the fourth quarter.
Full year underlying EBITDA grew by little over 1%. As I mentioned earlier, we are not satisfied with that level of growth but again, we have good momentum and look forward to improving this. And as I just covered on the previous slide, we executed on all of our capital management objectives.
Now, one final thought before I hand back to Dominic. As you know, we announced a few weeks ago that we had signed an agreement to acquire 85% interest in Miller Insurance Services. We expect that we will close in the second quarter subject to regulatory approval. We are excited about the prospect of joining forces with a leader in a London specialty wholesale segment.
I know the analysts listening will be interested in the impact of this acquisition will have on the consolidated financials. So, I want to comment on a few things that might help you understand the transaction better. First, Millerâs publicly filed partnership financial statements in the U.K. are not reported consistent with U.S. GAAP. So itâs tricky to analyze it on its metrics on a comparable basis.
However, I can tell you their pro forma standalone EBITDA margin is roughly in line with ours. As previously announced, we are not just holding Miller as is, we are transferring businesses both ways between Miller and Willis to better align our customer offerings. This, however, does create a bit of complexity but we will be transparent with the impacts.
Second, as with all acquisitions in this industry, we are acquiring intangible assets. We expect to amortize those assets on a standard accelerated basis in line with GAAP. So amortization expense related to this transaction will be relatively high in the early years. To provide a little more granularity, assuming a deal closes late in the second quarter we expect it will be broadly earnings neutral from 2015 through 2017. However, when you exclude the non-cash impact of amortization expense, this transaction is accretive in the range of $0.04 to $0.06 in 2015 and $0.10 to $0.15 in both 2016 and â17.
We will pay a little over 60% of the cash component of the consideration at closing and make three equal payments over the next three years tied to retention of key leaders. There is also a potential earn-out payment after three years based on superior performance. We assure you we will remain disciplined in our valuation approach. I hope this is helpful as you think about the impact of the transaction.
With that, Iâll hand it back over to Dominic.
Dominic Casserley
Thank you, John. So to close, how do we see 2015? While market conditions are far from ideal across our industry, Iâm convinced that the balance of our diversified portfolio coupled with the continuous improvement in how we bring all of Willis to benefit our plans, we will drive future growth.
This growth may not be evenly spread across all our businesses every quarter. But overall, we have enough growth engines to drive mid-single-digit organic revenue growth. I note once again that we are progressing nicely in our expense management initiatives. We finally lapped the investments we made in late 2013.
Weâve made good progress on our operational improvement program, finding ourselves slightly ahead of schedule on most metrics. That gives us all confidence about our ability to achieve the expected results. We will provide you with a full update on progress on that program with our second quarter 2015 results in July.
And during 2015 you should see our acquisitions delivering more to our results. In that context, as you know, by the end of April, we need to make a decision about whether we intend to exercise our option to buy the remaining 70% of Gras Savoye we do not own.
The Gras Savoye has franchises in France, Belgium, Eastern Europe, and Africa, with, as youâve seen from our Associates line, improving results in 2014. It is a potentially significant and differentiating addition to the Willis family. We will update you on our deliberations on that possibility towards the end of April.
So all in all, notwithstanding some challenging market conditions and the fact that performance wonât be even across every quarter, I am excited that the three elements of our value creation plan will work well in the full year 2015.
Let me go over the three components again. First, drive organic profit growth. During the year, we expect to see mid-single-digit revenue growth despite the challenges in some of our markets and improvements in our organic margin.
Second, invest strategically and in a disciplined manner in specialized businesses. For the year, we expect to see our existing larger acquisitions, Charles Monat, Max Matthiessen, and for part of the year Miller to deliver between $55 million and $65 million of EBITDA to the Groupâs results.
And third, continue to implement our operational improvement program. Recall that on an earlier slide we reported that we expect to achieve at least $60 million of India savings in 2015. We will update you on that figure in July.
At this time however, we expect that by the end of 2015 we will have completed projects associated with the program that on a full year run rate basis would deliver over $150 million of savings, that is half of our projected $300 million of savings.
Now far from all of that a $150 million would impact 2015, as many of these projects only lead to changes in our cost base towards the end of the year or into early 2016. But overall, we believe the impact of our organic cost management actions, combined with the impact in 2015 of our operational improvement program, will allow us to deliver at least 130 basis points gap between organic revenue and organic cost growth in 2015, with more of that spread coming in the second half of the year than the first.
Together, these three elements of our value creation strategy will drive growth in earnings, improve our margins, and increase our cash flow, all ultimately to drive shareholder value.
With that, I will turn it over to you for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Cliff Gallant, Nomura.
Cliff Gallant
Thank you. I appreciate the comments on your outlook for 2015. I want to follow up a little bit. A competitor of yours discussed headwinds in 2015 from low interest rates and the impact of a strong dollar. I was wondering if you could discuss those issues as you look forward to 2015.
Dominic Casserley
Certainly, I mean, we -- itâs certainly not a particularly interest rate environment, but I think most people presume that interest rates will be low. So we continue to believe that our interest income, which, in previous years, way back in time, was an important part of a P&L will be a very low number. We have obviously interest rates can also in some ways affecting pension valuations, we factored all that in. We know what that might do.
As to the strong dollar, obviously our underlying numbers, the numbers that we often have you focused on, we strip out the impact of FX exchanges year-to-year and because sometimes they hurt us and sometimes they donât hurt us. So all in all, when we look at how our underlying EPS will perform, we factored in all the things you talk about into how we see 2015.
John Greene
Dominic, if I can add in terms of FX, we do see a little bit of headwind from the strong dollar. So if currency rates were to remain exactly where they are as of the end of the year, we would probably have something in neighborhood of $0.03 to $0.07 worth of pressure on EPS from a reported standpoint. Now that will be uneven in the year. The first portion would be or the most predominant portion would be in the first half of the year and then the impacts would tail out towards the second half.
Cliff Gallant
Okay. Thank you. If I could have one follow-up. The Miller transaction, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about it, about the strategic thinking behind the deal and why the structure as youâve done it.
Dominic Casserley
Yeah, absolutely. We are very excited about both those things, the strategic opportunity in the wholesale markets in London and the way in which we have structured this to retain the attractiveness of pound going into Miller. I am going to ask Steve Hearn to provide a bit more background about how we see this.
Steve Hearn
Thanks, Dominic. Thanks for the question. So Miller, I think here people would recognize generally in our industry has been the preeminent private London wholesaler and an opportunity for us to work with business that has consistently performed over many years in a partnership model. An opportunity for us to take an investment in that business and to participate in what we believe strategically can be quite interesting environment in the London Insurance market. There is about 200 insurance broking firms in the London Insurance market. And we are seeing a trend towards consolidation there and a flight to quality of client and team and carrier. There is a move towards more alignment around the stronger better players and clients looking obviously for more and better service.
So we see an opportunity to sustain the Miller partnership and the Miller brand and use that as a way of accessing that particular part of the market. At the same time, we have history as Willis of being in the wholesale business. In fact, only a couple of decades ago, Willis would have been renowned as a wholesaler. We still have some core parts of our organization in London, which are wholesale in nature. And as weâve announced, we will be moving some of those businesses to sit within Miller and I think those businesses will be nurtured and grown very well by the management team in Miller. Likewise, there are some businesses within Miller that we think will work better clients, will be served better by sitting within Willis. And probably the best example of that will be the treaty reinsurance business in Miller, which we will be moving into Willis Re, which has been seen as again performed very well in 2014.
Cliff Gallant
Thank you.
Operator
Next question is from Sarah DeWitt, JPMorgan.
Sarah DeWitt
Hi. Good morning. On your guidance for mid-single-digit organic revenue growth in 2015, that would be up from 2.9% ex unusual items in the fourth quarter. So could you just elaborate on whatâs driving that and how you think about the run rate by segment?
Dominic Casserley
Well, I can give you some generic view. We have been saying Sarah for some time that we see the portfolio businesses we have being able to deliver mid-single-digit organic revenue growth. And I think we made very clear how we see the early views on the North American business. We continue to believe we have a very strong North American business and we are very comfortable with the pipelines momentum we have in that business.
Youâve seen how International has now performed over long period of time, both -- benefits from both quality of our teams and their ability to win market share and some underlying growth in some of markets whose combination has been highly effective.
And as youâve seen, weâve announced a restructuring of Group into four segments going forward and so we have slight change in configuration what used to be call global. And we think that more management focus on different parts of global combined with the unwinding of some turnaround activity weâve had in the last 18 months, particularly in our U.K. business gives us some confidence that that we will see growth there too.
But I would reiterate so what we said again and again, and I said in my call, it is the diversified nature of our growth engines, which gives us confidence that through the quarters we would lever mid single-digit organic revenue growth. Some parts will be up more than others in any particular quarter, but over the course of the year, we are confident where we are.
Sarah DeWitt
Okay. Thanks. And then on the amortization expense, after the close of the Miller transaction, what do you view is the right run rate for the total companyâs quarterly amortization expense?
John Greene
Yeah. So, Iâll take that one, Dominic. So, weâll see amortization without Miller of some -- just about where we were in 2014. So weâre expecting a mile uptick to maybe $57 million worth of amortization without Miller.
And then in my comments I talked about the impact of the amortization on EPS standpoint with and without the amortization. So those figures, you can calculate those on the back of the envelope.
Quite honestly, this transaction is subject to final closing. And as Steve alluded too and I talked about in my comments, the movement of businesses from Willis into Miller and some businesses from Miller into Willis will create a little bit of challenge in terms of trying to provide you a specific number on amortization at this point.
We also have a final balance sheet throughout that is yet to be calculated. So I would stick with the guidance that that weâve provided. We were explicit and thoughtful in the way we did that.
Sarah DeWitt
Okay. Great. Thanks.
Operator
Next question is from Kai Pan, Morgan Stanley.
Kai Pan
Good morning. Thank you for taking my call. First question is on the 130 basis point spread target for between the revenue growth -- organic revenue growth and organic expense growth? So it's great you have these deep specific goals? But what give you confidence you can achieve that? And in the case that your topline organic growth is below your mid-single digits target, given some market reasons, will you still be able to deliver that?
Dominic Casserley
Well, obviously, our 130 basis point margin -- not margin maybe the gap between revenue growth and cost growth organically that weâre forecasting for 2015 is a mix of how we see revenues developing, how we see our normal organic expense management initiatives and the flow-through of the operational improvement program during the course of the year. Thatâs why we have confidence in that number.
Now, if you would tell me that our revenue growth was before well below the range of mid-single digits weâre talking about into something you can no longer call mid-single digits. Clearly that number would be -- start to be challenge, but I think we would continue to believe, we will reduce the spread, but if you drive the revenues way, way down in any model you have, of course, you get less the spread. We donât see it that way. We don't see that way at all and weâre very comfortable with what weâre saying.
John Greene
And if I can just add there, there is one additional buffer there. So if the revenue doesnât come in the way we anticipated, our compensation expense of 20% is variable in nature, so its tied to production incentives, so that will also reduce. Should the topline not come in where we anticipated.
Kai Pan
Great. And then my second question is on your sort of cash and position. Given the acquisition you have done so far and also the pending Gras Savoye, you need to make a decision soon. How do you think of your cash position, given your projected free cash flow? Do you need to borrow more?
John Greene
Yeah. So when we look at 2015, we have an explicit assumption that Gras Savoye closes currently in 2016 should the Board authorized the option. So leaving that aside 2015, the way weâre looking at the cash generation of the business even with the acquisition of Miller, we don't see the need to go out and issue more debt.
There's a possibility that weâll pull on the credit line a little bit. As you know, we have a $800 million credit line. At the end pf the year, there was zero on that credit line. So there's certainly capacity within the business in '15 without issuing new debt.
Kai Pan
Okay. Great. Well, thank you so much for all the answers.
Operator
Our next question comes from Jay Gelb, Barclays.
Jay Gelb
Thanks you. For the first quarter which is by far though the largest contributor to earnings seasonally over the course of the year typically, would you still expect the spread to be positive between revenue growth and expense growth, and possibly even better than what we saw in the fourth quarter?
Dominic Casserley
Yes. We, Jay, are forecasting our spread over the course of the year. I said it will be more oriented towards the second half of the year. But clearly, our expectation is weâll produce a positive spread each quarter, but it's very much going to be -- the overall number youâre going to see in 2015 will be more weighted towards the spread performance in the second half of the year.
Jay Gelb
Okay. Thatâs helpful. On North America organic growth, in addition to tough comps year-over-year in terms of resulting in a slightly negative organic growth number in 4Q, is there anything else that you would view as a risk to not being able to show positive organic growth in North America during 2015?
Dominic Casserley
Let me turn over to Todd Jones to answer that one.
Todd Jones
Yeah. Jay, the short answer is, no. I mean, we tried to be very definitive about the performance in the quarter and what was driving that. And as Dominic talked about, the retention levels remained strong in the low 90s. Our new business performance is strong as well. So weâre going into 2015, specifically in Q1 and the full year confident in the underlying business for sure.
Jay Gelb
Okay. And then final one for the share count for 2015, will the buybacks essentially offset dilution from exercise of options resulting in essentially a flat share count for the year?
Dominic Casserley
Pretty much and thatâs the plans. So we said what we do, Jay, is every year we look at -- I say every year, now we are now into the second year of doing this. We look at the share options exercise during the course of the year, so in this case during the course of 2014. And weâre now buying back enough to offset that.
Jay Gelb
Makes sense. Thank you.
Operator
Our next question is from Josh Shanker, Deutsche Bank.
Josh Shanker
Yeah. Good morning, everyone. And Dominic, feel better youâre not the only one fighting the common cold I guess. My question involves the $11 million youâve saved so far with the operational improvement program. Are these jobs that have actually been severed over the $11 million salary that you continue to pay to people until the time that you sever them because you identify them as severance?
Dominic Casserley
These are real changes to the positive results of the firm, right. So these are real exchanges to the actual numbers of the organization. So they are out and thatâs why weâre saying that the impact of our action in 2015, you would see more of the impact of those in the second half of the year because obviously they only flow through the P&L when we stop paying people or their roles have been moved to a lower cost location and the roles that existed in the high cost location are no longer been paid for.
Josh Shanker
So when I see that you paid $16 million in termination benefit. Can I expect going into 2015 that a significant portion of that is run rate savings that youâre going to see on a quarter-to-quarter basis?
Dominic Casserley
Could you ask that question again, didnât quite, didnât quite -- can you just ask it again?
Josh Shanker
Yeah. So far youâve said termination benefits, I think, you said $16 million -- you spend $16 million in termination benefit. In 1Qâ15, if the vast majority of that non-repeating salaries that will taken out because youâve let those people go or how should I think about that $16 million what itâs composed of.
John Greene
So, Dominic, why donât I take that. So, yes, for the quarter there was $36 million restructuring charges. Josh as you know $16 million was termination benefits and that broke down between North America, International and Global. And we anticipate that the salary associated with that termination benefits will have left the organization. So we know, for example, that there were approximately 300 people net that came out of the organization that can comprise that $16 million of termination benefits.
So there is selective reinvestment in certain area which makes the comparison, Iâll say dollar for dollar a little bit more challenging. And there is inflation as you know between 2% and 3% when you take a look at our entire organization. So you can think about this as yes its real dollars out, there is some inflation going up against that and there is some mild reinvestment. But intention is as weâve said and we werenât -- and so far weâve done a pretty good job in terms of executing again.
And so the majority of the stuff is going to drop down to the bottom line. And as we said I think in my opening remarks that the cost saving we saw this year of $11 million, the annualized rate of those was $34 million. So thatâs I think a clear way of thinking about what the impact is.
Josh Shanker
Thatâs helpful. Thank you. And just to understand by the time someone has been identified as a potential redundancy. How long will you be paying salary and termination benefits for the individual before they come out of the floor?
Dominic Casserley
Where they are?
John Greene
Itâs very specific to geography. So if you think about France, so itâs closer to 12 months. Spain can be 12 months. North America is the function of time with the Group. On average that it would be somewhere between three and six months, in the U.K. itâs typically six months as the average. Three to six, thanks.
Josh Shanker
Thank you for the answer. I appreciate it. Good luck.
Dominic Casserley
Thank you.
Operator
All right. Thank you. And the next question is from Vinay Misquith of Evercore.
Vinay Misquith
Hi. Good morning. The first question I was wondering, if you could give us color on the sort on in growth in North America and maybe to an extent global. To what extent, do you think it's just purely because of timing versus -- sorry -- maybe some concerns around the restructuring efforts?
Dominic Casserley
Todd, you want to talk about North America?
Todd Jones
Yes, sure. I think your analysis is around -- the timing is a good one. As we think about the North American and specifically which is why we focused our comments on the construction business which by nature due to some of the project related revenue. Weâre going to have some unevenness in terms of the performance of that business.
We certainly donât think as we talked about through this call that there is anything to suggest anything other than optimism for 2015 about the business. And then, I think the impact of both the operational improvement program and some of the underlying strategies that we are executing on, I think we actually see those helping the business and supporting growth efforts into 2015 and as we think about years further out.
Vinay Misquith
Sure.
John Greene
So, a global perspective, so I think the question in there was with the restructuring efforts, anything to do with the economic performance in the quarter and Dominic can answer to that. It didnât drive it down in our revenue at all. But again, as I talked, we see the restructuring as a positive enabler for us is a business not an impediment. There are two parts to global. Firstly, the reinsurance business which is a global. And as you have seen, again had a very, very good strong quarter and particularly relative to its competitors and the headwinds that challenged it. Our U.K. insurance business as we talked about before is some of its parts. There are some things in there that perform very well in the quarter. Some which didnât do quite so well and some which really struggled both in the quarter and through the year. So, itâs the number of different things driving the quarter results but itâs not resulting from the restructuring efforts.
Vinay Misquith
Okay. Thatâs helpful. And just wanted to clarify that there are movement of employees that's really from a support staff perspective correct thatâs not really impacting being the producers?
John Greene
That is right. The operational improvement program is focused on overcalling the mid and back-office activities. And if youâve heard us described the program but the movement of staff is around people in those roles.
Vinay Misquith
Sure. And then just one last question, a numbers question. The tax rate picked up to 25% this year, so what's the normalized tax rate we should be expecting for the future?
John Greene
Yeah. So, Iâll take that one. We expect the tax rate to be in the range of 23% to 27%. It will be a function of the composition of the earnings throughout the globe that's why there's a range there. For planning your models, 25% probably not a bad number.
Vinay Misquith
Okay. Thank you.
Operator
Okay. Our next question is from Brian Meredith, UBS.
Brian Meredith
Yeah. So, one or two quick questions here and correct me if Iâm thinking about this correctly. But if I look at what your planned expense savings are in 2015 of $16 million that comes out to about 2% of the â14 expenses. Yet youâre only looking 130 basis points of kind of spread between revenue and expense growth. Does that imply that you expect underlying organic expenses to grow faster than revenues this year and if, so why?
Dominic Casserley
So we are obviously taking a buffer and therefore, how we think the year will turn out in terms of performance. But obviously as we said all along, Willis is a growth business. We have significant growth opportunities around the world. You should not imagine because we are focused on expense management, we arenât also focused on taking advantage of revenue opportunity in markets like China, Latin America, just a two examples.
So we are investing against our growth opportunities. But broadly, we are very comfortable with where see the combination of all those things turning out in terms of our results and the spread we could achieve in 2015 and our continued ability to invest behind revenue producing opportunities for â15, â16 and beyond.
Brian Meredith
Can you elaborate little bit on the investments spending, the reason I am asking, Dominic is, if this restructuring program wasnât going on, would that be whatâs happening, that we should expect from Willis, longer term is it expense growth outpaces revenue growth, if you donât have some kind of an expense save program going on? I mean, the other program, just not the case?
Dominic Casserley
No. No. Our math shows that we are still achieving an organic spreadâ¦
Brian Meredith
Okay.
Dominic Casserley
â¦ without the restructuring program.
Brian Meredith
Without you are still achieving organic growth, okay.
Dominic Casserley
Yeah.
Brian Meredith
Okay. Thank you. Thatâs all.
Dominic Casserley
Absolutely.
Operator
Thank you. And next question is from Thomas Mitchell, Miller Tabak.
Thomas Mitchell
Thank you. I have a couple of questions that I may just have misunderstood? But the $12 million in settlement proceeds that came in? Does that flow through to underlying earnings per share the $0.46 or is that excluded?
John Greene
No. The $12 million is included in the underlying. Itâs not part of commission and fees, its other operating income, just part of revenue. In the prior year there was $4 million related to a similar type settlement and in this industry, occasionally, when certain producer Groupâs or books of business end up moving in order to avoid litigation or lockup periods for employees, many times the receiver of those resources will pay a settlement and thatâs what we had in the quarter.
Thomas Mitchell
Right. But if we are putting a model together, we donât expect that every quarter, we donât expect settlement funds to keep flowing in every quarter?
John Greene
Yeah. I certainly would hope not.
Thomas Mitchell
Okay. Fine. Of course that means you lost producers, okay, fine. Thatâs very helpful. Now the other question is also about other expenses? I just notice that and again, I -- you correct me, if I am wrong. But the growth in salaries and benefits on an organic basis was well above organic growth in fees and commissions, so that the positive operating leverage from the quarter came, essentially viewed that way from a reduction in other operating expenses? First of all, is that a correct way to look at it, and then second of all, going forward, what would -- what should we look for in that area?
Dominic Casserley
Right. Let me have overall answer that well. John, I guess, the numbers, the fee -- reduction in other operating expenses is part of our ongoing expense initiative and reflect some rationalization we did in terms of some of our specific branding spend we did in 2014.
And we think thatâs a good set of scrutiny and initiative we did. The -- the salary and benefits numbers had some peculiarities in them, weâve shown we will go through related to prior year comparison and some specific incentives paid in International, which made the number look large when if you think about that.
John Greene
Yeah. Exactly. So in terms of, let me, start with other operating expenses. So other operating expenses did go down in the quarter versus the prior year quarter. As Dominic said, there were some marketing and brand-related expenditures that did not repeat in â14. There was also, just as part of our overall expense management, we took a look at systems infrastructure and we found a particular system that had market appeal and we didnât feel like we are the best owners of it. We sold it and we had a $3 million reduction to expense in the fourth quarter.
In terms of the salary and benefit growth in the fourth quarter, it was 5.5%, as I said in my prepared remarks. I also included in the slide deck that page that shows that S&B from an organic standpoint between the first half and the second half of 2014 was essentially flat.
The reason I thought that was important was because in the fourth quarter itself, in terms of the production awards, the International segment had a couple of triggers that took an adjustment in the fourth quarter up, it didn't exist in the previous quarters.
So if we straight line that, had we had a perfect insight in terms of how International would have done, there would have been a much more smooth S&B between quarter and quarter. So that's one component of it.
The other component of it is, frankly, a level of inflation. So we have significant operations in Asia and in Latin America the inflation rates in those countries are much greater than the U.S. or the U.K. So on a blended basis we have inflation of about 2% to 3% reflected in 2014 versus 2013.
So one of the leverage that we are continuing to focus on is the FTEs that we have, they are big pieces of cost base. The operational improvement programs in place in order to ensure our FTE base is as cost effective as it possibly can and we are going to continue to drive those numbers.
Thomas Mitchell
This is very helpful. Thank you very much.
Operator
Okay. Next question is from Bob Glasspiegel of Janney Capital.
Bob Glasspiegel
Good afternoon. Can you walk us through what the acquired revenues look like for 2015 for modeling purposes? And also what the minority interest calculation might look like for the last three quarters?
Dominic Casserley
For the last three quarters.
Bob Glasspiegel
Miller, I guess, wonât you be taking 15% out, if you only on 85%.
Dominic Casserley
No. I am sorry. Yeah.
John Greene
Yeah.
Dominic Casserley
Yeah.
John Greene
Yeah. So in terms of the minority interest related to Miller, we are not -- we are actually not going to get in that level of granularity on this call. We havenât closed the transaction. We have a number of elements we have to work through.
In terms of the M&A numbers, we have included within the press release detail of what those numbers are. Now typical convention when we look at these is that we will use 12 months of revenue as inorganic and then it falls offâ¦
Bob Glasspiegel
Okay.
John Greene
â¦ and becomes organic. So an easy kind of analysis on that would be actually quite difficult for this call. And honestly, at this point I prefer not to go through that.
Dominic Casserley
We can go back to you, Bob. We have said, I think, what we think the EBITDA impact in 2015 of these acquisitions will be, right. And we canât give you the exact minority number against Miller, because we havenât closed the transaction and there are lots of moving parts between it, as John explained.
Bob Glasspiegel
Okay. I will -- Iâll nail Peter with some follow-ups, but I think there is stillâ¦
Dominic Casserley
Thatâs fine.
Bob Glasspiegel
â¦ an equation with too many unknowns, they have specific components to be reasonable. And this could impact margin analysis but certainly we can do it. Our more strategic question, you guys havenât given short-term guidance in many, many years and it seems to fly in the face of your sort of native instincts, the little Iâve gotten to know you to put a target out there that we can shoot at. Whatâs the tactical reason that youâre going back to giving guidance and can we read into this that youâve got a level of confidence that youâre seeing things behind the numbers that give you confidence that you can actually put a target out there to shoot for?
Dominic Casserley
The reason weâve done this is that you will remember that about 18 months ago, we had an investor conference and gave median term guidance on revenues and what we saw in terms of, I mean, the spread between our revenues and costs. Weâve been very clear that in 2014 that we did pretty well in the revenue target, we certainly did not do so well on the gap between revenues and costs. And therefore this time we thought it was important that our markets and investors understood how we saw 2015 specifically operating on that margin spread given what we said 18 months ago. As to the second part of your question, as to confidence, we wouldnât have said it if werenât confident. 
Bob Glasspiegel
Okay. So we can look that youâre going to be given near-term earnings guidance on a go-forward basis. And once you start giving guidance, you sort of have to stick with it, I think?
Dominic Casserley
What we were clearly not to be doing, Bob, is giving quarterly guidance.
Bob Glasspiegel
All right.
Dominic Casserley
And we will -- when we get to this call next year, weâll decide what we want to do in terms of again reassuring people about how we see the two key components of organic performance, which are how we see revenue growth and how we see the spread between revenues and costs but weâre definitely not getting into the game of quarterly guidance?
Bob Glasspiegel
Thank you.
Dominic Casserley
Thanks.
Operator
All right. Our next question is from Mike Nannizzi at Goldman Sachs.
Mike Nannizzi
Thanks. Just a couple here, on the International segment, lots of organic growth there but it didnât seem like your margins really reacted that much. Iâm guessing there were some expense investments. Just trying to get an understanding of the operating leverage in that segment and how we should think about how much organic growth should help to support margin expansion there?
Dominic Casserley
Let me hand over to Tim to talk about the dynamics of that International portfolio.
Tim Wright
Thanks for the question, Mike. Obviously, we had very strong revenue growth in the quarter even adjusting for the revenue recognition change last year. And there was margin expansion but it was modest as you say. I would say not to repeat everything that John just said but I think he covered it because these are high growth markets. There are costs associated with that growth. But also we did have some exceptional incentive payments that were triggered in the quarter that probably narrowed that margin even further than you would expect it to be on an ongoing basis. So we are absolutely in the International segment looking to achieve positive operating leverage on the back of strong continued growth.
Mike Nannizzi
Okay. Thanks. And then, just on that nickel or so of other income, the settlement to that contract. Iâm just curious, I mean, so when we think about underlying should we be thinking about that is kind of sort of a run rate earnings and if so, it sounds like thatâs a one-time item. Is there a reason that we should think about that being part of what would otherwise be kind of interpreted as an underlying earnings number?
John Greene
So what we tried to do is be consistent with how weâve treated in the past actually. So I mentioned in my comments that there were $4 million gain settlement in 2013 fourth quarter. In previous quarters and previous years, those sort of settlements have come through other operating income. Now this is -- I appreciate, it is taking out. The quantum of the settlement is three times bigger than the number last year. So from my standpoint, these settlements means -- typically means some producers are going somewhere else. And in this case, they did not go to a competitor to be clear.
So itâs not something we plan for, nor do we budget it. So I would say there is a trend through history that indicates there will be some sort of settlement. Now I would expect that $12 million is in outlier.
Mike Nannizzi
Got it. Okay. And then just on the share issuance in â15 in the offsetting buybacks. In mean, is this something we should expect will continue? I mean, is there a backlog of options that are sort of coming through and so you kind of see or get some idea of how thatâs going to play out or is -- are we be going through the bulk of that if you do have that level of visibility in â15? And at some point we can think about buybacks reducing the share count, how should we think about that dynamic?
Dominic Casserley
Well, at the moment, we just had a policy unlike which is about offsetting that effect of share option issuance. Thatâs how we set our buyback. Thatâs how weâre going to manage it for 2015.
Mike Nannizzi
Yeah.
Dominic Casserley
So weâre offsetting the â14 issuance in â15. Weâre going to monitor what happens in â15 in terms of how much we have and then weâll make another decision at the end of the year. But we made clear now, you can say itâs 22 years, we made clear that our ingoing starting approach is that we at least seek offset that impact on the share count.
Mike Nannizzi
Got it. So we shouldnât be thinking beyond â15 that there's an opportunity for that share count to just net come down that we should just be thinking about the buybacks and share issuance sort of neutralizing one another.
Dominic Casserley
That would be an ingoing modeling assumption. Yeah.
Mike Nannizzi
Okay. Great. Thank you.
Dominic Casserley
Thanks.
Operator
The next question is from Meyer Shields, KBW.
Meyer Shields
Thanks. Good morning. I guess a couple of questions. With Gras Savoye, there was a $6 million improvement in your share of the results from fourth quarter last year to this year. Can you break that down between FX movements and actual fundamental improvement?
Dominic Casserley
Let me give, while John thinks about that. Let me give you some overall. So 2013 was an unusual year for Gras Savoye. They were doing their operational improvement program, if you like -- levels of it and those costs ran through all the numbers in 2013 and little bit into 2014 but mainly in 2013. And so we had some delta at that program that didnât affect the numbers very much in 2014.
But nevertheless, the underlying performance of the business did improve and has been improving and we feel good about that in terms of each contribution to us. So thatâs the underlying whatâs going on. Now that we have John think about FX here.
John Greene
And Iâve thought about it, Dominic and I donât have exclusive answer on that at this point related to Gras Savoye. The improvement as Dominic said from what we've seen both, looking at the financials from the business as well as the activities that have happened, thereâs fundamental operational improvements in Gras Savoye that is driving the improvement. But what weâll do after the call is we will post some information and Peter will get back to Meyer if thatâs okay.
Meyer Shields
Yeah.
Dominic Casserley
Tim, do you want to try to this? Tim Wright?
Tim Wright
Just a very small point. But first of all, obviously, itâs predominantly euro-denominated. Two-thirds of its business is in France. A third of its business is outside. Some of that business outside also has a euro linkage. But there is a significant proportion maybe a quarter that is non-euro- denominated and actually may even benefit from improvements in the dollar position. So there is a degree of offset and complexity even within the numbers. Itâs not just a straight euro thing.
Meyer Shields
Okay. Thatâs very helpful. If you decide to buy Gras Savoye, what currency do you pay for it, is that euros?
Dominic Casserley
Yes. The transaction is denominated in euros.
Meyer Shields
Okay. Are there any hedging -- is it too early to consider hedging, given how strong the dollar has been relative to the euro recently?
Dominic Casserley
So Meyer we actually looked at that. And at this point, we donât have a decision from the Board. The management team is going to come through and make a recommendation. The Board has in terms of preliminary discussions been supportive. The final outcome will depend on due diligence.
In terms of from that decision point through to the end of the year, when we look at the forward rates, the euro interest rates are going to be low for sometime based on those curves. We looked at locking in rates and actually we found that to lock them in at this point it would be uneconomical based on our projections of interest rates. But we are going to continue to evaluate that shortly after we have the decision from the Board.
John Greene
Now I would remind you that the present structure is for us not to close that transaction until the summer of 2016. So we are looking quite far out at this point in terms of the hedge we have to do.
Meyer Shields
Okay. Thatâs helpful. And one more question if I can. I am not sure I understood whether the expectation for mid-single-digit organic growth, does that apply over the course of the year to all four of the new segments?
Dominic Casserley
No, as I have said, pretty clearly I think number of times we see the combination of our portfolio delivering that growth. You saw in the fourth quarter how quite weâre uneven, but we delivered mid-single digit. And we think during the course of the year, the portfolio will continue to perform strongly in that mid-single-digit range quarter-to-quarter, some will be up more than others. Often, as you know, the comparison can be simply relating to a particularly strong or a particularly less strong quarter. It can affect the percentage downturn. So again, I would have you focus on the portfolio and how itâs going to perform.
Meyer Shields
Okay. Understood. Thanks so much.
Dominic Casserley
Thanks.
Operator
Next question is from Adam Klauber of William Blair.
Adam Klauber
Thanks. Good morning. A question on cash. Look like you used roughly $770 million of cash. When I look at your release, I think you generated cash -- I lost my number -- generated cash around $460 million, you ran down cash by another $160 million, so there is like a $100 million, $120 million gap of where cash came from, where did that extra cash come from?
Dominic Casserley
So you are right, we have been continuing to work hard on our cash management activities and we will continue to do so. And the combination of those various things has enabled us to continue to drive our management of cash. John, do you want to talk about that?
John Greene
So there is cash from earnings. Certainly, we also had sales of slow growth offices in North America which I think cash impact there was $70 million, $80 million positive.
Adam Klauber
Okay.
John Greene
We had the settlement that we talked about for another $12 million and there is a big chunky items then the rest is still working capital. Weâve had a pretty consistent effort to try to do two things on the working capital piece. One was extend payable days. Weâve done that. That will turn into about $20 million cash in terms of bringing it forward. And then on the receivables, weâve just began starting work on that to ensuring that conversion cycle from essentially billing to remittance and we are hopeful that that will enhance the cash position in 2015.
Adam Klauber
Okay. So as we think about 2015, right now you have $635 million of cash. Can that balance come down somewhat again andâ¦?
Dominic Casserley
Yes. Yeah. So the way, we think about it right now is that in terms of the cash that we need for working capital purposes, as well as from a regulatory standpoint and particular geographies is between $400 million and $300 million.
Adam Klauber
Okay.
John Greene
So that means there is -- call it, $300 million of cash available for investing opportunities.
Dominic Casserley
So thatâs why we are very comfortable in thinking through our ability to absorb the Miller payments and continue to do the share repurchases during 2015, with some call maybe upon our revolver but not having to issue more debt. So thatâs how we are comfortable with that.
Adam Klauber
Okay. That makes sense. And then one question on Miller. Very good organization, so you have a very good deal. Will that be the majority? I think you mentioned $55 million of potential additional EBITDA. Will that be a majority coming -- is it coming from Miller?
Dominic Casserley
It obviously depends when we close, exactly how much it will come from Miller. But the combination or integration of Charles Monat, Max Matthiessen, some smaller deals, I think weâll continue to be the majority in 2015.
Adam Klauber
Okay. Thank you very much.
Dominic Casserley
Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our last question is from Mark Hughes of SunTrust.
Mark Hughes
Yeah. Thank you. When you look for the faster growth in revenues than expenses, should we start on a base if we are doing some modeling at the 18% organic operating margin or the 17% reported operating margin?
Dominic Casserley
It depends on what you want to model, I think. So, let me tell you how we think about just to help you to think about it. Obviously, why weâve given you more transparency this time around is to make sure you see more clearly how our organic business is performing and be very much. When we are doing our additional planning, we look at our organic business for the coming year and how we see that performing. Okay. So we are interested obviously in how we see that market, then we lay on top of that acquisitions and how we see that they impact.
And then we think through whatâs the impact of the operational improvement program in here because as weâve said to you, when the impact of the operational improvement program actually hits the numbers, depends on frankly timing of when the project gets finished, when people actually move and when the people actually leave the organizations. So we think through those components.
And so we have an organic view of the firm and then we have if you like, an underlying view of the firm, which will explain those things. And thatâs how we model it and we are obviously interested in driving EBITDA coming out all of it in ways of looking at the company and the margin in both of them.
Mark Hughes
Right. So, when you provided the guidance your thought was the base for 2014 was the organic performance of the business rather than the reported, which was about as I said, about a 100 basis point lower?
Dominic Casserley
Yes. So the -- when we said that revenues will grow faster than expense growth by 130 basis points that is -- we said thatâs organic revenues and the impact of organic transactions and the impact of the operational improvement program in 2015.
Mark Hughes
Right. Okay. Thank you.
Operator
All right. There are no other questions at this time.
Dominic Casserley
