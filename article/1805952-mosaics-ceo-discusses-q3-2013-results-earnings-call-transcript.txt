Good morning, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to The Mosaic Company's third quarter 2013 earnings conference call. At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode. After the company completes their prepared remarks, the lines will be opened to take your questions.
Your host for today's call is Laura Gagnon, Vice President, Investor Relations of The Mosaic Company.
Laura Gagnon
Thank you, and welcome to our third quarter 2013 earnings call. Presenting today will be Jim Prokopanko, President and Chief Executive Officer and Larry Stranghoener, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We also have members of the senior leadership team available to answer your questions after our prepared remarks.
After my introductory comments, Jim will review Mosaic's accomplishments for the quarter and our views on current and future market conditions. Larry will share insights into our results and our future expectations. The presentation slides we are using during the call are available on our website at mosaicco.com.
We will be making forward-looking statements during this conference call. The statements include, but are not limited to statements about future financial and operating results. They are based on managements' beliefs and expectations as of today's date, November 5, 2013 and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties.
Actual results may differ materially from projected results. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are included in our press release issued this morning and in our reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Now, I would like to turn it over to Jim.
Jim Prokopanko
Good morning. Thank you for joining our earnings discussion for the third quarter of 2013. We have a lot to talk about today. So let's get right to it.
First, as you are all aware, the external business environment was very challenging during the quarter and that is clearly reflected in our results. We operate in a capital intensive cyclical industry where prudent capital allocation is critical to competitive success. While troughs are a part of every cyclical industry, these periods provide significant opportunities for companies like Mosaic, companies with strong balance sheets and the ability to execute an effective strategy.
Our earnings reflect the difficult operating environment but it is worth noting that Mosaic was still able to generate operating earnings of $144 million on revenue of $1.9 billion. These results include $142 million or $0.22 per share in negative notable items. These are largely non-cash, and they are primarily the results of strategic decisions that I will discuss in more detail.
We have built a highly resilient business and we continue to manage the company for the long-term as our results and actions this quarter demonstrate. The current market conditions do not change the long-term outlook for Mosaic or our strategy. We are focused on building reliable long-term sources of cash flow and we are succeeding at that in both business units.
In phosphates, our Saudi joint venture is progressing well and we are reinforcing our advantage cost position. In potash, our expenses remain on budget and on schedule and we are in the process of demonstrating the capacity of Esterhazy K2. Our innovation lead continues to grow with the launch early next year of our new potash premium product, joining the strong performance over MicroEssentials product.
We have also made major strategic strides in the past few months, further positioning Mosaic to achieve its vision of being the world's leading crop nutrition company. Last week, as you know, we announced that we reached an agreement to acquire CF Industries' phosphate business for $1.2 billion plus $200 million for their asset retirement escrow.
We also reached a long-term agreement for CF to supply Mosaic with a substantial portion of the ammonia we need to manufacture phosphate products. These deals make perfect sense for Mosaic and for our shareholders. Because of the proximity of CF's South Pasture mine to Mosaic's planned Ona mine, we will no longer need to build a full beneficiation plan at Ona, which would have been a $1 billion investment.
The ammonia deal, allowed us to forego a proposed ammonia plant in Louisiana, which would have cost $1.1 billion. Most important, after the transaction closes, we will have increased phosphate capacity to help meet growing global demand and capture substantial and highly probable operating synergies.
We recently reached two additional strategic decisions. First, we intend to sell our assets in Argentina and Chile and exit our distribution business there. Our business model simply did not match with the markets' demands, which is primarily a barter market and our profitability was not sufficient to justify continued investment.
Our South America strategy is focused on Brazil, where the future of agriculture remained very bright. Second, we are in the process of decommissioning our small potash mine in Hersey, Michigan, where we are facing significant capital outlays for potash reserve development and where we are preparing to sell it as a salt production mine.
Together, these two decisions and the cancellation of the ammonia project resulted in pre-tax charges of $123 million, which was largely non-cash in the results we reported today. All of these actions fit perfectly with the strategy and streamline our operations, and we expect all the will contribute to greater shareholder value in the years ahead.
Now, I will return to the current markets. Prices for both, potash and phosphate slipped lower, driven by a number of factors, including to name a few, the weak shipments into India and China and late harvest in North America, all of these factors are leading to very cautious hand-to-mouth customer buying decisions.
We have always said that economics will win in the end and we believe that continues to be true. The current situation is primarily driven by good oil supply and demand. Supply is increasing and shipments are temporarily soft. We expect these conditions to persist into 2014, but over time, we expect demand will return.
The world's farmers simply cannot grow their yields and their profitability without our products. As I said earlier, this is a cyclical business, but the long-term trend is solidly upwards.
The 2013 crop is likely to come in as the biggest ever and farmers are prospering and that's very good news for global food security. Even so, even with the largest crop the world has ever produced, yields must grow substantially from here to meet future demand.
Simply extrapolating the trend from the last 30 years, demonstrates the need for significantly higher yields, and of course, more fertilizer application. Farmers continue to reap large profits with their large crops even with moderating grain and oilseed prices.
Revenue and profit per acre matter to farmers. Crop nutrients are extremely affordable they are helping drive strong yields, which in turn drives compelling farm profitability. Over time, economic fundamentals will be in our favor. The outlook for the rest of the decade for potash supply and demand looks balanced, even as new capacity comes online and we expect operating rates to rise to the mid-80% range.
For phosphate, the long-term supply and demand equation is positive and we expect to operate at high rates in that business over the coming decade. In fact, if you look at phosphate demand, it is difficult not to notice the continued steady growth. A trend that bodes well for our two recently announced investments. Overall, the quarter was challenging, but we see brighter days ahead.
Now, I would like to ask Larry to provide more context on this quarter. Larry?
Larry Stranghoener
Thank you, Jim. Given the complex nature of our results, I would like to spend some time helping you understand our performance and then I will provide our guidance for the fourth quarter. Our earnings reflect market realities as well as the largely non-cash negative notable items of $142 million in this quarter including the $123 million in charges Jim mentioned which reflect important strategic choices we have made.
Market set prices for our products but we can control our cost. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $94 million during the quarter, down from $115 million last year. This decrease was driven by lower incentive compensation and benefits combined with the end of costs associated with last year's corporate systems initiatives.
One item that likely has drawn your attention is our negative cash flow for the quarter. Timing worked against us this year. In the month of June, the first month of our seven months stub year, cash from operations was $434 million, so our year-to-date cash flow from operations for the stub trade was strongly positive and is expected to more than double by the end of the year.
We anticipate improvement in domestic demand, now that the North American harvest is winding down and farmers are focusing on fall applications, and this will draw down inventories. While we do not expect any meaningful short term price appreciation, the expected reduction in working capital should result in a more normalized operating cash flow situation in the fourth quarter.
Moving on to the segments. In potash, net sales were down significantly, as a result of lower realized prices and lower sales volumes, primarily to North America, both driven by factors I just described. Note that operating earnings for this segment included the charge for the exit of the Hersey, Michigan potash mine. We produced two million tons of product during the quarter, building inventory as a result of the ongoing Esterhazy K2 proving run, which is nearing completion. Our Colonsay mine remained idle during the quarter.
In the phosphates segment, net sales, margins and earnings were down due to lower prices and volumes as the phosphate business experienced a spillover effect from potash. Buyers of crop nutrients generally got significantly more cautious. Lower finished phosphate pricing was only partially offset by lower raw material prices, which I will address shortly. This segment's operating earnings also reflect two charges, the exit from the Southern column of South America and discontinuation of the ammonia project.
Normally there is roughly a quarter lag between market prices of raw materials and prices we realize in our cost of goods sold. This quarter, however, we have lower sales volumes and as a result, a much longer lag. Much of the benefit from lower raw materials prices went into finished goods inventory. We expect cost of goods sold to decrease offsetting further phosphate price declines as we work through this higher cost inventory during the fourth quarter.
In fact, we anticipate ammonium and sulfur prices realized in our cost of goods sold to decline to $405 and $120 per ton respectively in our fourth quarter. Our results in both segments highlight both the seasonal and cyclical nature of our business and the necessity of maintaining low-cost operations. As we discussed at our Analyst Day presentation last month, we are well positioned on the cost curves in both potash and phosphate and we are working to further reduce costs.
Now a few notes on capital deployment. First, we do not expect the CF phosphate acquisition to have an impact on our ability to repurchase shares, whether from the MAC trusts or in the open market. We continue to look forward to late November after which our repurchase restrictions will be lifted. We also intend to take advantage of some of our additional debt capacity in the near future. We were restricted from issuing bonds while we were in material negotiations regarding the CF transaction. Now that we have announced the transaction and will file a current 10-Q, we expect to conduct an offering soon assuming market conditions remain favorable.
Now, I will turn to guidance for the fourth quarter of 2013. We expect potash sales volumes to be in the range of 1.5 tons to 1.9 million tons compared with actual volumes of 1.4 million tons in the same period of last year.
We expect average realized potash prices to be in the range of $285 to $310 per ton. The gross margin rate for the Potash segment is expected to be in the mid-20% range. Our operating rate in potash during the fourth quarter is expected to be below 65%, with planned Esterhazy maintenance after successful completion of a proving run.
Brine management expenses are expected to be in the range of $45 million to $55 million for the quarter and Canadian resource taxes and royalties are expected to be in the range of $40 million to $60 million.
In phosphates, sales volumes are expected to range from 2.5 million tons to 2.9 million tons for the fourth quarter, compared to 2.8 million tons in last year's period. We expect our realized prices for DAP to range from $370 to $400 per ton. The gross margin rate for the Phosphate segment is expected to be about flat with the third quarter.
Mosaic's phosphate operating rate is expected to be approximately 80% during the fourth quarter. Also, for the fourth quarter, we estimate SG&A expenses will be approximately $90 million to $105 million. For the seven-month stub period, we estimate an effective tax rate continuing in the high teens percent range and capital expenditures and investments in the range of $900 million to $1.1 billion.
With that, I will turn the call back to Jim for his concluding remarks.
Jim Prokopanko
Thank you, Larry. Clearly, our markets are challenging part of the cycle. As we have stated many times, we know our business is cyclical and we plan for the trough, so that we can take advantage of the opportunities they present.
At Mosaic, we are addressing the things we can control and our strategy is working as our very important strategic progress over the past few months makes clear. At our Investor event last month, we reinforce our commitments to reducing sustaining capital and operating expenses and improving our position on the global cost curves.
Our approved potash expansions are on track with work progressing at our Esterhazy K3 shaft, which will give us significant optionality in the future. Earlier this year, we proactively delayed our additional brownfield expansions and Belle Plaine and Colonsay due to higher capital costs.
In the past six months, we have announced the investment in a joint venture in Saudi Arabia, the purchase of CF Industries' phosphate business and an the expansion of our footprint in Brazil, all to position us to capitalize on the very favorable long-term fundamentals.
Today, we have discussed additional strategic decisions, which along with our plans to return excess capital to our shareholders, are designed to optimize returns on our invested capital and generate shareholder value over the long-term. We have build an adaptable company designed to succeed in the dips, accelerate in the peaks and find opportunities throughout the cycle. Our results demonstrate that we can do just that. We are well positioned to succeed now and to amplify our success when not if markets improve.
Regardless of the markets, you should expect more of the same from us, steady, prudent management and a willingness to seize opportunities, all with the continual commitment to generate solid returns for shareholders.
Mosaic's future is bright both, because of our strategic progress and because of the remarkable opportunities ahead. Our future is tied to the greatest challenge of our time, a challenge that will increase for generations ahead feeding this growing planet. The world has to grow more food, a whole lot more food and it simply cannot do so without good crop nutrition. Therein lies the value of Mosaic, an excellent franchise built to withstand the troughs and prosper throughout the cycle supported by compelling future demand story. That's great opportunity for the long-terms for all of our stakeholders.
Now we would be happy to take your questions. Operator?
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
(Operator Instructions). Your first question comes from the line of Joel Jackson from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Joel Jackson - BMO Capital Markets
Hi, thank you. Just looking at some of your guidance for volume for Q4, you seem to be guiding to similar volume for Q4 '12 but for some higher volumes for potash. Could you just talk about how you see International and North America in Q4 versus Q4 of last year for the two businesses, how they might differ?
Jim Prokopanko
Sure. Good morning, Joel, Thanks for leading off our question period here. I am going to turn it over to Rick McLellan to address the volume forecast. Rick?
Rick McLellan
Yes. Good morning, Joel. Your question is about how we see Q4 domestic and export versus last year. The thing is, probably the biggest impact on our Q4 is the fact that North American buyers didn't come to the table during our Q3 this year where last year, if you remember, the fall application season and the crop was harvested four weeks ago at the same period last year. So we saw the dealer network not step in for product and year-over-year, we think the export market stays relatively the same. So the growth is going to be, or what we expect to be in the quarter, is all around capacity.
Joel Jackson - BMO Capital Markets
Okay, and just following up. On some of your asset sales you are talking about here in Brazil, excuse me, in Chile and Argentina and in the Hersey mine in Michigan. Could you talk about what self production was in 2012 or calendar '13 and then also in Argentina, what percent of the Argentina, Chile assets would you guess would be attributed to SSP plants and is that capacity on SSP 250,000 tons? Thanks.
Jim Prokopanko
Joel, you asked two questions. One was about salt production. I am going to have Joc O'Rourke speak to that and the other question was about SSP production and Larry Stranghoener, our CFO can answer that. Joc, would you address the salt questions?
Joc O'Rourke
Yes, last year our salt production at Hersey was somewhere in the range of 250,000 to 270,000 tons of salt. So it was approximately four to five times the amount of potash produced at that operation. And we have a long-term contract to sell that salt to Compass Minerals.
Larry Stranghoener
And Joel, with respect to the assets in Argentina. The great majority of the assets there are inventory. It's their prime season right now. So inventory values are quite high. SSP plant is a relatively small part of the asset value but could in fact be the most attractive asset we have for sale.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of PJ Juvekar from Citi. Your line is open.
PJ Juvekar - Citi
Yes. Hi. Can you talk about brine management cost? You were down significantly. Can you talk about what were the reasons behind it? Was it reduced production or your other drilling techniques et cetera?. And what is a reasonable estimate going forward?
Jim Prokopanko
PJ, good day. We are going to have Joc O'Rourke, our Chief Operating Officer leading our production facilities address that. Joc?
Joc O'Rourke
Yes, thank you, PJ. So our brine management cost have been down and that is the combination of some success and some of our, we talked about it a year ago, doing some growth curtaining, as we called it, in some horizontal drilling. That's complete. So that's allowed our cost to come down a little but certainly not related in any way to production because its an independent operation. But overall, it comes down to better management, I think, and some of the success of our (inaudible) programs.
Jim Prokopanko
An PJ, I would just add, ongoing costs are expected to range from $45 million to $55 million per quarter.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Mark Connelly from CLSA. Your line is open.
Kurt Schoen - CLSA
Thank you. This is Kurt Schoen, in for Mark. With your cancelation of the ammonia plant, how much more ammonia will you guys need once you expand the Ona and DeSoto mines, and would you guys consider building an ammonia plant at that time to kind of fill that shortage.
Jim Prokopanko
Kurt, it's Jim here. We are going to be deficit. We have the demands for about 1.5 million between what we will have the CF contract and with we produced of our own in the Louisiana. We will have deficit of about 300,000 tons to 350,000 tons and we are considering what the options are to fill that hole.
It doesn't hurt being open to some spot market prices and we will figure out that as we go with this contract with CF being so new, just give us some time to figure out what's the best way to fill that deficit.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Chris Parkinson from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
Chris Parkinson - Credit Suisse
Perfect. Thank you. On the Phosphate business, you indicated that that may take some time to realized the full benefits of lower sulfur and ammonia costs. Can you give a little more detail on how to think about this going forward as we head into 2014, given particular consideration to current inventory levels? Thank you.
Jim Prokopanko
Larry, why don't you handle that question?
Larry Stranghoener
Yes. I think as we tried to point out on the call, there is typically about a three-month lag and they probably got extended by a month or so, just because of slower sales and inventory build, but generally speaking, if you look at the market prices, those are the prices that were being realizing cost of goods three, four months later. The trends are certainly positive with respect to ammonia and sulfur cost and that's helping up preserve margins in this business even as prices continue to slip a bit.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Ben Isaacson from Scotia Bank. Your line is open.
Ben Isaacson - Scotia Bank
Thank you very much. With respect to Canpotex, we are seeing several of your competitors being more aggressive in product placement strategies as well as several large MOUs being signed recently. Can you talk about whether market share retention, which is I guess the strategy you talked about at your Investor Day. Can that be achieved without having to sacrifice prices any further?
Jim Prokopanko
Good question, Ben, and there seems to be a lot of [built] about market shares. More than market shares, we look for customer retention and Canpotex has been an exceptional add. There aren't many, many customers in the world that want all their eggs on in one basket, so with all the noise and sparks that are going on the in the last couple of months, they are starting to settle down.
We got the world market in the a high 50 millions tons, 57 million tons, 59 million tons. No one supplier can supply all that product, so when they run out of if some customers want to sell it at a lower-price let him sell at a lower price, but we know who our target customers are continue, we continue to serve them, serve them, very, very well and they want to do business with Canpotex, so we are not getting into a market share war here. At least not from my perspective.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of from Jeff Zekauskas from JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Jeff Zekauskas - JPMorgan
Hi. Good morning. You indicated that your tax rate for the stub period will be in the upper teens. Why is that? Why is it so much lower than in the first half of the year?
Jim Prokopanko
I have our CFO, Larry Stranghoener answer that. Larry?
Larry Stranghoener
Like all companies, Jeff, we have certain tax preferences, and when income is falling there is somewhat perverse effective of tax rate improving, because we are still enjoying some of these tax preferences against the lower pretax pace which results in a lower tax rate.
I think on a normalized basis, you should think about tax rate in the low-to-mid 20s going forward.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Kevin McCarthy from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.
Kevin McCarthy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Yes. Good morning Larry, it seems you have got quite a few moving parts in your capital budget with CF deal and the ammonia project forgone and other portfolio actions. How would you characterize CapEx prospects for 2014 or even any preliminary comments looking beyond that, in terms of the shape of your spend?
Larry Stranghoener
Yes, Kevin. It's something we are spending a lot of time talking about internally, of course, and planning for. We are not yet at a position to give guidance for 2014 but I think we have seen the peak years of CapEx with the potash expansion program largely behind us at this point, other than the K3 mine. So you should look for CapEx to begin tapering off a bit. Of course, one of the appeals of the CF deal is that is it was CapEx neutral for us. Yes, we are spending $1.4 billion but in so doing, we are also saving about $1.4 billion in future capital outlays. I would call your attention to the slide we used at the Analyst Day presentation that tried to sketch out for you over the next three to five years, what the various markets would be from sustaining capital to growth capital and so on.
Jim Prokopanko
Kevin, that's Jim. I would just like to add to that and it is important questionable capital allocation that you bring up. Being a cyclical business and being a capital intensive business with the scale and scope and cost of some of our expansions, capital allocation is critical to success in this. I think Mosaic's really differentiated itself, building a strong balance sheet able to finance our capital expansions through operating cash flow. We take it very seriously and that's what has been behind some of these repositioning our portfolio. The exit of the Hersey operations. We just couldn't find a way to justify the capital expenditures that were necessary to expand the caverns at Hersey based on the price forecast we have going on and similarly, Argentina and Chile, we are exiting those markets because we just can't see deploying capital and getting the kind of returns we were looking for. So it is an important thing in this business to do that smartly and do that well with discipline.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Jacob Bout from CIBC. Your line is open.
Jacob Bout - CIBC
Hi, good morning. I had another question here on the Esterhazy brine management. Can you talk a little about any changes that you have seen in the salinity of the composition of the brine? And then, in that forecast of the $45 million to $50 million, maybe you can give us a bit more of a breakdown of what you are spending on pumping versus grouting? That's it. Thanks.
Jim Prokopanko
Hi, Jacob. It has been a while since we have heard from you. I am going to have Joc address your brine question.
Joc O'Rourke
Okay, Jacob, Joc O'Rourke here. Yes, in terms of the brine chemistry, again it's a little difficult to be exact on it, but we haven't seen any substantial changes in the saturation of the brine at Esterhazy. To your second question, pumping versus grouting, I think if you go back to our Analyst Day, a couple of years ago we did break that cost down and essentially our cost haven't changed in terms of distribution, pumping being about a third of the total cost, grouting being about a third and drilling being about a third of the major cost and those would account for 80% of the cost of managing brine.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Don Carson from Susquehanna Financial. Your line is open.
Don Carson - Susquehanna Financial
Thank you. Jim, a question on potash pricing. You are guiding down about $30 in the fourth quarter. You have talked about how you think that we haven't seen the bottom yet and the price would deteriorate further into next year. So where do you think prices trough?
Then as I look at slide nine, which is your longer term outlook, you have got a bump in global operating rates in 2014, but then a flat line for the next five years. So are you expecting prices to remain flat? Or do you think that producers will start shutting some capacity or maybe we will get a bump in demand out of India to help with the pricing what's otherwise a flat supply demand environment?
Jim Prokopanko
Yes. Hi, Don. Good to have you on the call. The potash question about, I will take the supply side or the demand side and Rick will talk to you a bit about the price outlook. We are expecting continued 3% growth annualized in the potash business over the next number of years. It's going to be lumpy and we have proven that. You just don't know when it's going to come but we will see over this decade a 3% annual growth rate.
What has been an anomaly over these past two years is the reduction in demand by two consumptive markets, India in demand, India and China, I should say. Their demand shipments into those countries are both, down about 2 million tons each, so both countries combine 4 million tons has been removed almost 10% of 7%, 8% of the annual demand has been removed by those actions. We don't think that is sustainable, we are convinced that both of those markets are going to come back and we are anticipating that some time by the end of this coming 2014 year that we will see that demand begin to come back.
The other aspect of it is what's happened in the pipeline. There is shipments and that is what is down 4 million tons between India and China and there is farm consumption. In our reports and our study of the market is that the farmer consumption isn't down to the same level that shipments are down. We think the Indian farmers are applying good rates to both potash and phosphate and we are seeing pipeline, stocks drawdown, so with the recovery and eventual and I think within 12 months, we will see a recovery in China and India. We will start seeing more pricing, the prices firming up and we will start seeing prices move up.
I am going to turn it over to Rick and see if he has any color to add about what we see in the next - you asked about the fourth quarter pricing.
Rick McLellan
Hi, Don. Although we don't see any business on potash being consummated in India or China, we do believe that either late this calendar year or early next year they will have to come in and Jim talked about the pipeline destocking and that will be the impetus that will provide a move for price.
The good thing about markets destocking is that we are seeing it in India, we are seeing it in China, we are seeing it in Brazil, three of the big markets and we have had a very good start in October to the North American fall application season.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Michael Piken from Cleveland Research. Your line is open.
Michael Piken - Cleveland Research
Yes. Good morning. Thanks for the question. Just wanted to dig a little bit deeper in terms of the outlook for phosphate next year, you guys have talked about sort of where you see the potash demand and shipments being for next year. Could you talk a little bit more about phosphate? How big of a deal is the India subsidy system with respect to phosphate and how big could we expect the shipments to be in India for 2014 in phosphate? Thanks.
Jim Prokopanko
Good morning, Michael. Rick McLellan, our commercial leader will take that question.
Rick McLellan
Yes, Michael. If we look at next year, our expectation is 64 million tons to 66 million ton of phosphates globally, and that will be the fifth concussive year of demand growth for phosphates. When we look at India, Jim talked about it a bit. We believe that while imports have declined on DAP to near 4 million tons this year, channel inventories at retail distribution have been drawn down at as part of applications have been solid, so this would frankly imply that we will see imports into India next year at 6 million tons to 6.5 million tons of DAP, which is part of what we expect the growth to be in the market. The second question, could you repeat it please?
Jim Prokopanko
I will just to add on to that. Rick called it out, but we have seen five consecutive years of year-over-year growth in the phosphate business. I just want to underline we got tremendous confidence in the growth of the phosphate business, the necessity of this is the one of the three principal nutrients and that's what's behind our conviction in investing both, in the Saudi phosphate joint venture as well as the most recently announcement agreement we have with CF to buy their phosphate business. This is a good solid business with steady growth prospects proven and into the future.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Adam Samuelson from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs
Hi. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. I was hoping if I could - more into the potash inventory situation, you have built about 580,000 tons of inventory in the quarter and your 4Q operating rate guidance and volume guidance, at the lower end would say, you don't expect to draw that down at all. Maybe talk about how comfortably you are carrying current levels of inventory into 2014 and maybe any more color on the split between standard and granular product that you have that would color how you would respond to a demand recovery in India, China versus the U.S. and Brazil ?
Jim Prokopanko
Good day, Adam. Good question. Particularly with us having our K2 proving run going on. So there is some explanation needed. I am going to have Joc and Rick speak to that to the inventories of potash.
Joc O'Rourke
I am looking forward by talking about the Esterhazy proving run. As you are well aware, I am sure the way we determine our allocation with Canpotex is by doing these proving runs. So they are quite important in terms of recognizing the value of our expansions. At Esterhazy, we are nearing the completion of our proving run and we expect that we will demonstrate a capacity consistent with our already declared annual increased capacity. So that's going very well. But what it has meant is, we have had to run an operation, a little harder than we would normally run or a lot harder than we would normally run, particularly in this market. So it's meant, we have added inventory, at the same time we have had Colonsay shutdown for two months which has tried to mitigate it, but we are still increasing inventory.
With that, I am going to hand it over to Rick to talk about the demand side and how we are going to deal with that.
Rick McLellan
Yes. Adam, as you look going out of the year, there's a couple of point of clarification I will make. The high-end of our range is the expectation that there will be some tons go to both India and China. And at the low end of the range is mother nature working against us in North America. So right now, we are very comfortable with the ranges we have provided and we think the market, frankly as we look at what our inventories will be at the end of the year, it will give us that flexibility to respond when the pipelines are drawn down and the market begins to move. If we think back over the last two year's, Q1 has been really strong for potash.
Jim Prokopanko
Yes, I would just add to that. This market that we have experienced over the last two to three years, these aren't slow slowdowns or slow startups. Things happen pretty quickly these days. So having some inventory and having a buffer to respond when the markets come back and when they do come back, I think they will coming roaring back and that will happen quickly. So we will be well prepared to serve that market as the demand picks up.

(Operator Instructions). Your next question comes from the line of Mark Gulley from BGC Financial. Your line is open
Mark Gulley - BGC Financial
Good morning, Jim. You talked about being able to control costs in this tough market. I wonder if you can talk a little more about Carlsbad. You did refer to that in your cost curve analysis at your Investor Day. Is it possible there to curtail potash production while maintaining K-Mag production?
Jim Prokopanko
Mark, I have said it earlier and you are highlighting it. Everything is on the table. The potash sector has had quite a shock since July 30 causing everybody, I think, certainly I could speak for Mosaic, causing us to reassess how we deploy our capital. And that's a question we ask ourselves. Do we continue to run our Carlsbad facility? Continue to run the MLP? Slack demand that we are seeing now, we might not need that capacity. But it's a question we have asked ourselves. We are studying. K-Mag is a great market. We have no intensions of curtailing any K-Mag. So it's important we keep that going. And stay tuned. You will hear more from us.
Larry Stranghoener
Mark, it's Larry. Just to be clear. Yes, we could operate the K-Mag part of the plant without operating the MLP part of the plant.

Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Korn from Barclays. Your line is open.
Matthew Korn - Barclays
Hi. Good morning, everyone. Could you give us just some, maybe more specifics on the time of the expected buyback? Larry just confirmed that you looked to participate in the debt markets by the end of the year and you have talked about balance sheet optimization by the middle of next year.
First, is it still the intent that the lion share if any repurchases will be probably be done by late spring? Then secondly, you said you don't expect to see a transaction to impact your ability to buy back shares. What could feasibly happen to change that type of outcome or that expectation, maybe could you not go to the debt markets when you want, could approvals for the deal get pushed back? Things kind of linger? What would happen there?
Larry Stranghoener
Matthew, it's Larry. I don't think I am going to give you the kind of detail you would like to hear in that it is not clear yet how many shares we will buy, from whom we will buy them, when we will buy them. It depends a lot on market circumstances, it depends upon the willingness of the trust to sell their shares, willingness to sell how many of those shares which isn't clear to us yet, so it's still a bit of fluid situation.
I would go back to what we have been saying. We have got capacity of roughly $4 billion between debt capacity and existing cash. There are some calls on that capacity. This EPA escrow account that we have described to you before and it is described in our 10-K and 10-Q, other strategic opportunity that might come up, but in the end we still have ample capacity for share buybacks, we have got a strong desire to return capital to shareholders via buyback.
Of course, we will have no restrictions left after late November, and so we will look forward to developing and finalizing our plans at that time. I would add one final comment with respect to our balance sheet targets, we said that we want to hit those targets by mid-2014, so Matt you process all of that information and you can come with I think some reasonable estimates about what we are likely to doing and when we are likely to do it.

Your last question comes from the line of Don Carson from Susquehanna Financial. Your line is open.
Don Carson - Susquehanna Financial
Yes. Just a follow-up on your FPD program, I know in Slide 13, you talked about how your volume dropped considerably on that, so how much of your potash is moving out on that? Are you having to give a steeper discounts off list in order to induce the dealers that to hold material?
Jim Prokopanko
Hi, Don. I am sorry, we dropped your first question and we didn't get your second question. I am going to have Rick address that now
Rick McLellan
Yes, Don. Year-over-year, we are up. We don't talk about what we have in the program, but we are up on volume. As far as discounts, right now we are in gut slot and people are taking the inventory that they have and it's moving to market at the prices that we expect.
Jim Prokopanko
Well, with that I am going to conclude our call and I would like reiterate a couple of our key messages.
First, we understand the cyclical nature of our industry and we have planned well, so that Mosaic can thrive in the peaks and in the troughs. Our financial strength and conservative management approach are proving to be valuable assets.
Second, we are making important strategic progress, highlighted by the Saudi joint venture, the pending phosphate acquisition and our decisions to exit underperforming businesses.
Finally, the long-term outlook for Mosaic remains extremely compelling. Economics, supply and demand will prevail and demand for our products will grow along with the population and the need for more food.
Thank you for joining us today and have a great day.
